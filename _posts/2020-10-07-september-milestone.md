We bring another month of new features, fixes, and improvements in documentation and developer experience in LoopBack. Make sure to update your compatible projects with `lb4 update` if you want to update the underlying libraries to their latest versions.

Also, as part of our long-term effort to encourage more community contributions, we are participating in this yearâ€™s [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). You can read more about the event and participation details at our [Hacktoberfest blogpost](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/2020-hacktoberfest/).

## Documentation Enhancements

There has been a continuous effort to improve our documentation. Below are some highlights for this month:

- A new documentation page, [Accessing HTTP request and response objects](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Accessing-http-request-response.html), was added explaining the various ways and places to access the request and response objects.
- We are working on a series of troubleshooting guides for LoopBack. This month we completed the [basic guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Troubleshooting.html) and [Debugging tests with Mocha](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Debugging-tests-with-mocha.html). [A few more areas](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/5701#issuecomment-700955686) that can be added to the guide.
- We added an [example app](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/binding-resolution) demonstrating LoopBack 4's context binding resolution and dependency injection within a context hierarchy.

## New Experimental Features

- We have created a [GraphQL extension](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/extensions/graphql) that provides integration with GraphQL using [type-graphql](https://typegraphql.com/). Check out the [GraphQL example app](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/graphql) for a sample app.
- We added support for parsing [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) bodies. For usage, refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/bodyparsers/rest-msgpack).

## Investigation on Better Handling of ObjectID in MongoDB

We spent a good amount of time to improve the experience of using `ObjectID` with LoopBack. We have identified the direction we want to take and the tasks to work on. You can learn more about the spike in issue [3456](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3456).


## Fixes and Improvements

- [added `.onStart()` and `.onStop()` methods of the `Application`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6230), so that they can be used to register observers as plain functions for the start and stop life-cycle events.
- [enhanced the `lb4 update` command](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6398) to be runnable against any projects that use `@loopback/*` dependencies in `dependencies` or `devDependencies`, or `peerDependencies`; not just LoopBack 4 projects.
- [included the application build when running `migrate` and `openapi-spec` scripts](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6390).
- added `@injectable`, so that `@injectable` can be used instead of `@bind`, which is in tune with other frameworks using Dependency Injection. `@bind` is not removed from the framework, so apps using `@bind` will not be affected.
- made the `keepAliveTimeout`, `headersTimeout`, `maxConnections`, `maxHeadersCount`, and `timeout` properties of the underlying [HTTP server](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v14.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_server) instance [configurable by specifying them in the application config object](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6267).
- [updated the generated application directory name during application scaffolding](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6429) when application names involve numbers
- added [the ability to boot dynamic value provider classes and classes with `@inject`](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6315).
- removed the `extension-` prefix from the affected extensions for their names to be consistent with other extension modules.
- [improved the overall experience of graphql configuration and subscriptions](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6313) in LoopBack. 
- added the [support of OpenAPI parameter AJV validation](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6285) on simple types and [AJV formats for OpenAPI spec data type formats](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6262).
- [updated the REST middleware](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6284) so that it can now cached by the use of singleton binding scope.
- added Twitter example in the [Passport login example app](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/passport-login).

## Community Contributions

Shout out to [Rifa Achrinza](https://github.com/achrinza) for explaining the differences between weak and strong relations in PR [6404](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6404), [MessagePack PR](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6155), and his numerous other PRs.

Opening issues are community contributions too, so thanks to all those who help LoopBack become better by reporting bugs and usability issue.
