Last week IBM held its [InterConnect](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/) event in Las Vegas, Nevada bringing together many different IBM groups, partners, vendors, and customers to talk about a wide array of technologies. The StrongLoop crew was in force the entire week including numerous presentations and demos. Our very own CEO, now VP of Interaction Services, Juan Carlos Soto was up on stage for the general session on Tuesday running a live demo of [API Connect](http://ibm.biz/apiconnect) including creating an API model and deploying the application on the fly! Various other members of the StrongLoop team presented on topics such as building APIs with [LoopBack](http://loopback.io), pitfalls of the Node.js API, comparing Node and Java, and how to build out a microservice architecture. We also had clients sharing their experiences with LoopBack and StrongLoop and journeys into the API economy! There were stories of trials with Node.js and also success stories in creating new business models to disrupt their competitors.

There were, of course, many other sessions on all sorts of topics, but a recurring theme did seem to come through: that the API economy is here to stay. Everyone was talking about connecting this service or that back end with APIs &#8211; and all of the issues that come along with that. How can companies reinvent themselves in this new API-driven world? One way is to take existing data and services traditionally behind monolithic applications and expose them over smaller microservice APIs. This was a big theme of the many of the API Connect sessions and conversations throughout the event. You can read more about how IBM is [disrupting the API economy](https://developer.ibm.com/apimanagement/2016/02/24/disrupting-the-api-economy-at-interconnect-2016/) over on the developer works blog. If you missed the event, watch that blog for more information on the sessions.

### Node.js and IBM

The other big topic that was prevalent (and growing stroner at IBM) was Node.js, thanks in large part to the [acquisition of StrongLoop](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/ibm-acquires-strongloop-to-extend-enterprise-reach-using-ibm-cloud/) last year. In addition to some great sessions on Node.js itself, there were plenty of demonstrations using Node, some of those with APIs, but many with IoT (Internet of Things) devices as well! There was even a [Nodeschool](http://nodeschool.io/) session led by a few IBMers contributing directly to Node ([James Snell](https://github.com/jasnell), [Bert Belder](https://github.com/piscisaureus), and [Jordan Kasper](https://github.com/jakerella)). Nodeschool is program to teach JavaScript and Node.js to developers. Each lesson is broken out in easy to consume steps, usually paired with mentors who help coders get through some of the more difficult steps.

In case you haven&#8217;t heard, IBM is investing heavily in Node.js &#8211; both from financial and human perspectives. They are a platinum member of the [Node Foundation](https://nodejs.org/en/foundation/) and have people working in the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) and contributing code directly to the project. With IBM&#8217;s commitment to APIs, it&#8217;s only natural for us to also contribute to Node.js &#8211; a great option for developing microservices and APIs.

### Join Us Next Year!

Don&#8217;t be sad if you weren&#8217;t able to attend this year, [IBM InterConnect](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/) will return in March 2017! We encourage you to come out then and meet some of the amazing talent at IBM that is working on Node.js and API Connect.
