Today marks an important milestone for the StrongLoop website. It marks the transition from showcasing our services to promoting community. While we did support and promote community previously, our site primarily highlighted options from IBM and StrongLoop to help you power the API economy. Moving forward, this site embraces our role within the open source community that creates APIs and supporting the growth of that community.

## Supporting the Open Source API Developer Community

With our renewed focus on Open-Source options for the API developer community, the StrongLoop site will primarily feature the following:

### Projects

[LoopBack](http://loopback.io/), [API Microgateway](https://github.com/strongloop/microgateway), and [Open API Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) - three key open source technologies for API creation. 

### Events

The StrongLoop team will continue to sponsor and attend events because these are important to us and the community. This includes meetups, informative webinars, and developer conferences. We'll provide a list so you know where to find us!

### Blog

We are proud of the work that the StrongLoop and IBM team, as well as members of the community, have created on the [StrongLoop blog](/strongblog). When we updated this site, we archived outdated posts and migrated posts to appropriate locations. Articles related to API Connect are now in the [DeveloperWorks - API Connect blog](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/blog/). Node-related content has moved to [Node.js @ IBM DeveloperWorks](https://developer.ibm.com/node/blogs/). We will continue to provide the same strong content here, focusing on building APIs with Open Source solutions.

### StrongLoop newsletter

Each month we will email a summary of articles, news and announcements to help you stay in the loop. You can subscribe and review archives [https://strongloop.com/newsletter](here).

## History

In March of 2013, the StrongLoop team introduced their supportable Node.js solutions. At our launch, we embrace the community Node distribution, adding features to improve Enterprise adoption while making major contributions to Node core. We nurtured our relationship with the Node.js community online and at meetups, hackathons, and conventions.  We shared informative tutorials and how to's for our offerings and Node.js and JavaScript. After being acquired by IBM in September 2015, we innovated more quickly, increased our global market reach and customer support and launched exciting new products to create and design APIs. We re-established our commitment to LoopBack as an Open Source framework, re-invigorating its documentation, adding features, and establishing plans for significant revisions and improvements. 

All through these developments, we continued to engage the Node.js community. We attended events, learned from our users, and provided strong and useful information on our blog. StrongLoop began with a focus on Open Source software within the Node community. We've evolved to offer additional Open Source API  software, extending our presence in the open source community.  We're proud of how developers helped shape and grow the StrongLoop community, and we want to pay it forward by continuing to help promote Open Source solutions for API development. We are excited that IBM continues to contribute to and support this StrongLoop community! 

## The Future

We are excited about our new focus on APIs and the open source developer communities that builds them. We plan to continue to deliver relevant content and resources to help you be part of the API economy. Want to stay looped in? Check out these options:
