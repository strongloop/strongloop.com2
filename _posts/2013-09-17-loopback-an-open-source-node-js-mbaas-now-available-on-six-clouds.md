Most mobile developers want to focus on the interface and interaction of their apps and not get caught up in having to figure out how to write a backend, connect it to data sources or worse how to manage and scale it. With this in mind, StrongLoop is pleased to announce the immediate availability of the LoopBack mobile backend-as-a-service (mBaaS) on your choice of six supported clouds, including:

  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Amazon </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Heroku </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Cloud Foundry </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Red Hat’s OpenShift </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Rackspace Cloud </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Cloud9 IDE </span>

By deploying StrongLoop’s mBaaS on the cloud you gain a fast and accessible way to build APIs and connect your mobile apps to data sources. You also inherit the benefits of cloud, including: on-demand resources, auto-scaling and depending on your cloud provider, varying degrees of automation and management control.

## **<span style="color: black;">What is LoopBack?</span>**

LoopBack is an open source mBaaS based on Node.js, supported by StrongLoop and bundled inside the StrongLoop Suite distribution. LoopBack leverages the accessibility and ease-of-use of JavaScript and the power of the Node.js community’s contributions, so that developers can easily connect their devices and browsers to data. This data can exist in the cloud or behind the corporate firewall. LoopBack also ships with an iOS SDK so you can interact with your models and data sources in a comfortable, first-class, native manner.

LoopBack uses a model driven architecture, which automatically exposes backend data sources as REST/JSON API and an native client SDK on mobile devices to remotely access these APIs. So for example a table from an Oracle database will show up in iOS, without any coding. Of course this setup can be configured and extended in so many ways because LoopBack is written in Node.js, leverages community modules and thus an ecosystem of plug-ins, and is open source so you can customize and contribute. It’s even easy to call local functions on a mobile device that execute on the backend.

We’ve put together a short video explaining our motivation behind creating the LoopBack project and the problems it aims to solve. Have a look:

## **<span style="color: black;">Why run LoopBack on the Cloud?</span>**

If you are a mobile developer looking to develop applications that need access to data that resides in the cloud and the datacenter, there’s quite a few advantages to running your own private mBaaS on a cloud:

  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">LoopBack is open source and doesn’t lock you in to where you are running. Don’t like the cloud, switch to your own datacenter! </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">LoopBack is built on Node.js, so if you know JavaScript you know LoopBack </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Out-of-the-box, LoopBack connects to enterprise data sources like Oracle and MongoDB </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">LoopBack ships with an iOS SDK, so you won’t have to compromise on functionality or inherit a steep learning curve </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">The cloud let’s developers focus on what they care about most, application code, not how to build, patch, network, load balance and scale servers. </span>
  *  <span style="font-size: medium;">Depending on the degree of automation your cloud provider offers, it can scale applications automatically to handle spikes in traffic </span>
