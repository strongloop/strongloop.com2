Do More with APIs

Join us as we demonstrate the techniques and technologies to build Apps that combine Node.js, one of the most popular languages for creating APIs, with Watson Visual Recognition one of the most powerful vision recognition engines in the world.

The interactive session will also touch upon best practices and complimentary technologies such as Swift and Googleâ€™s Geo-Location APIs to allow creation of unique experiences.
