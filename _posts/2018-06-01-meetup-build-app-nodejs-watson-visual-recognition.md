Join us as we demonstrate the techniques and technologies to build Apps that combine Node.js, one of the most popular languages for creating APIs, with Watson Visual Recognition one of the most powerful vision recognition engines in the world.

The interactive session will also touch upon best practices and complementary technologies such as Swift and Google’s Geo-Location APIs to allow the creation of unique experiences.

Presenter
Dennis Ashby (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennisashby/) is the Director of IBM's Developer Advocacy team in the IBM Cloud Integration Business. He is a self-describe code junkie and lover of all things geek.

Session #2

This session will introduce and explore a developer focused tool, MicroClimate, that provides cloud-based rapid inner loop development and DevOps integration. You will learn about leveraging cloud patterns such as container-based development and enabling fast repeatable setup and configuration.
