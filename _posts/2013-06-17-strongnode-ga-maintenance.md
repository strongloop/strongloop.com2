**NOTE:** StrongNode is no longer available. We recommend [API Connect](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/getting-started/) for building APIs.

StrongNode 1.0.2 Maintenance Release is now available for Windows, Linux and MacOS X. It comes packaged with the latest and greatest, Node.js v0.10.11 (Stable). In case you missed the official [announcement blog](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/announcing-strongloop-node-1-0-ga-an-enterprise-ready-node-js-distribution/) last week, new in this release:

- npm upgraded to 1.2.30
- libuv upgraded v0.10.11
- plus more…

If you’d like to take a deeper dive into what’s new beyond the official release blog, you should check out our weekly “What’s New in Node.js and libuv” blog posts which give you plenty of color and commentary on what’s happening on the development front.

Of course, StrongNode still ships with the slc command-line utility and a set of supported npm modules, including:

- Express – web application framework
- Connect – rich middleware framework
- Passport – simple, unobtrusive authentication
- Mongoose – elegant mongodb object modeling
- Async – higher-order functions and common patterns for asynchronous code
- Q – a tool for making and composing asynchronous promises in JavaScript
- Request – a simplified HTTP request client
- Socket.IO – cross-browser WebSocket for realtime apps
- Engine.IO – transport layer for real time data exchange
- SL Task Emitter - perform an unknown number of async tasks recursively
- SL Config Loader – recursively load config files
- SL Module Loader - separate your app into modules loaded by config files
- SL MQ – MQ API with cluster integration, implemented over various message queues
