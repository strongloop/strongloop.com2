Are you heading to [Node.js Interactive](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive)? It's the premier event for those who use Node.js - developers, companies, and vendors. In addition to providing great dialogue and networking around Node.js, the event also provides a great opportunity for attendees: the chance to help support and provide book donations for local children through [Tux's Bookworms](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive/extend-the-experience/bookdonation)! 

## What's Tux's Bookworms? 

The site for Tux's Bookworms describes the initiative: "a project aimed at increasing literacy by providing more options for young readers an initiative to provide books to children in low-income areas and contribute to the development of future generations." It does so by donating books to children located in the host city of the conference. The initiative's overall goal is to get 20,000 children’s books to share.

## How can you help?

If you want to support this great cause, it's easy! Simply bring one or more of a children’s book, including books in Spanish and books for young readers (ages 0 – 8). Leave the textbooks, encyclopedias and adult books at home, though, as Lux's Bookworms cannot accept those. There will be a donation station near registration at Node Interactive, and you can drop your books off there - and even personalize them a message if you want. If you would prefer to purchase your books at Vancouver rather than travelling with them, find out where to get them - and get more information - at the [Tux's Bookworms site](http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-interactive/extend-the-experience/bookdonation).
