The API Strategy & Practice Conference - better known as APIStrat - is in its eight year. The event gives attendees opportunities to learn and discuss the API economy and all related things. The event homepage explains more about APIStrat:

*"The API Strategy & Practice Conference provides a forum in which leaders in the API sector can gather to discuss successes and challenges they face while executing their own API strategy. The API community comes together to hear these stories, participate, and discuss what is needed to move forward, in order to ensure the healthiest and most vibrant API sector possible."*
