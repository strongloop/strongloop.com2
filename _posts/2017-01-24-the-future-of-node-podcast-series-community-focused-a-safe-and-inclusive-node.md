IBM and StrongLoop partnered with [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) to sponsor &#8220;The Future of Node&#8221; Spotlight series, recorded at Node Interactive 2016 in Austin, Texas.

Changelog is a podcast and digital media company focused on telling developer-centric stories. They’re hacker to the heart. You may know them best from their popular podcast “The Changelog” &#8211; a weekly podcast that covers the technology and people of open source. It&#8217;s about the code, the people, and the community.

In this episode, host Adam Stacoviak talked with Tracy Hinds, the Education Community Manager for the Node.js Foundation. They talked about the efforts being made towards a safer, inclusive community and their events, open source documentation and tooling for conferences, and everything in-between.
