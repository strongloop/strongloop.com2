[ASC](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/asc-2019/), the API Specifications Conference, takes place October 15 - 17 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in less than a month. ASC promises to provide opportunities for API practitioners to come together and discuss the evolution of API technology.

While this is the inaugural year for ASC, the event and its producers have a history! You may recall APIStrat, which ran for nine years. ASC is a direct evolution of the API Strategy & Practice Conference. Its goal is very much aligned to the one  APIStrat pursued. ASC's site states:

*"ASC includes cutting edge technology keynotes and sessions that chart the future of APIs, in-depth specification and standards discussions and an extensive tutorial track. The event is designed to be highly interactive with plenty of discussion time throughout the workshops and sessions. OpenAPI Specification, RAML, API Blueprint, gRPC, OData, JSON Schema, GraphQL, AsyncAPI and other formats will all be topics at the event, enabling attendees to get familiar with these formats and discuss how to use them in practice."*

There will be many sessions at the event so attendees can learn. We've listed some highlights below from the IBM team.

Chris Phillips, Integration Architect and Master Inventor, IBM 
* [Turning External Services to Internal APIs](https://sched.co/T6tr) 
* [API Shop Window - Providing the Best Experience for your API Consumers](https://sched.co/T6tx)

Michael Kistler, Senior Technical Staff Member, IBM
* [No One Wants to Call your API](https://sched.co/T6uX)
