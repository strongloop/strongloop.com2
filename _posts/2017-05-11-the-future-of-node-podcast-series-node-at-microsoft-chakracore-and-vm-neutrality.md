<p>We're sharing another episode of The Future of Node series from Changelog. IBM and StrongLoop sponsored Changelog’s The Future of Node Spotlight series at Node Interactive 2016. Adam spoke with event attendees about Node.js and the Node community. In this podcast, Adam discusses Node at Microsoft, ChakraCore, and VM Neutrality with Gaurav Seth and Arunesh Chandra.</p>

<p>Changelog is a podcast and digital media company that tells developer-centric stories. They’re hacker to the heart. You may know them best from their popular podcast “The Changelog”.

<p>Adam recorded this episode of The Future of Node series at Node Interactive 2016. He talked with Gaurav Seth and Arunesh Chandra about a variety of topics: the backstory of Node at Microsoft, their polite fork of Node to introduce the community to ChakraCore (the high-performance JavaScript engine that powers Microsoft Edge), why Microsoft is so interested in Node, the future of Chakra and ChakraCore, VM neutrality, in addition to other topics.</p>
