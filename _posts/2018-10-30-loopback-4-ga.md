We've come a long way since the first Developer Preview release of LoopBack 4 was out last November. We are pleased to announce the GA release of LoopBack is now available! As some of our users have done it already, you can now build a LoopBack 4 application that is ready for production. 

In this release, we have created an [eCommerce application](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping) to help us identify gaps when creating a real-world application. Users can now also [expose GraphQL APIs](http://v4.loopback.io/oasgraph.html) as well as REST APIs in the same LoopBack application.

We focus on the following epics in this release:
- Model Relations
- Integration with REST / SOAP services
- Validation and Coercion
- Deployment to IBM Cloud
- Benchmarking and Performance
- KeyValue Repository
- Top-down approach (?? for lb4 openapi)

Letâ€™s take a closer look at each epic!

## LTS Policy
(WIP - LoopBack v4 is now the current version, v3 is the active LTS version and v2 is the maintanence LTS version.)


## What's Next?

Going forward, we'll maintain our keen focus on helping our early adopters to use the framework and to encourage contributions from the community.  If you find anything we need to enhance or fix, don't shy away from letting us know through [opening GitHub issues](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues). Better yet, submit a pull request and we will help when necessary. 

In addition, we will continue to use the scenario-driven approach to drive the requirements through the [e-commerce LoopBack application](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping).  Stay tuned for our progress in our monthly milestone blog posts.
