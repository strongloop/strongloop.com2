HackerJS is a NodeJS & JavaScript community meetup group that connects on the second Wednesday of each month. Whether you are a newbie or expert, the group strives to have a mix of beginner and advanced talks. We're excited for the first talk and still finalizing the second one.

### "Building a Centralized Log Management Framework" 
**Faazil Shaikh**

Discover what a log is. Weâ€™ll talk about syslog as a standard and system, its variants and the challenges of building of a centralized logging system and why small web applications should be collecting all of this valuable data. We will also discuss the design of centralized logging systems and cover the various types of solution within this space. Finally, we'll chat about how these ideas helped form Crato.

Crato is an easy-to-use full-stack log management framework for small web apps. Crato Client is a Bash application on the client side that forwards logs to a central server. Crato is a centralized log management system built using Rsyslog, Node.JS, Apache Kafka, AWS S3 and InfluxDB. Crato Core processes, enriches the log and delivers it ultimately to AWS S3 and InfluxDB.

Faazil Shaikh is a software engineer with experience in full-stack web applications, building with JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, React, and NodeJS.
