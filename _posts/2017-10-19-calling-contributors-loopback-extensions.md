One of the objectives of LoopBack 4 is to promote extensibility to [grow the ecosystem](http://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Crafting-LoopBack-Next.html#objectives). Some of the popular extensions voted by the LoopBack community are authorization support, support of other protocols (e.g. gRPC, MQTT) and other API styles (e.g. GraphQL, XML). As we're wrapping up on the LoopBack4 Core Beta release, we'd like to call for your contribution to develop extensions with us.  
 
## How it works ##

### Tell us ###

Let us know which extension you'd like to build by signing up in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/647). Here is the wish list voted by the community: [#512](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/512).
