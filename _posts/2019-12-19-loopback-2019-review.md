As 2019 draws to a close, we wat to follow our annual tradition of looking at the hard work that the [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) team has achieved in the past year. LoopBack 4 was the main focus, and that focus has resulted in a lot of improvements and features for the framework.

First and foremost, it was wonderful to congratulate LoopBack for earning the 2019 API Award for the “[Best in API Middleware](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-2019-api-award-api-middleware/)” category. Celebrating the technical innovation, adoption, and reception in the API & Microservices industries and use by a global developer community, the 2019 API Awards were presented at the 2019 API Awards Ceremony during API World 2019.

Check out the timeline and some frequently asked questions [here](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/lb3-extended-lts/).

In "Migrating from LoopBack 3 to LoopBack 4", by Nora Abdelgadir shared a way to mount your LoopBack 3 applications in a LoopBack 4 project. You can read about it [here](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/migrate-from-loopback-3-to-loopback-4/).

### More LoopBack How-To Content

While we were looking to the future as we built LoopBack 4, we continued to provide tutorials and "how to" content for LoopBack as well.  

### Events

While the LoopBack team is generally quite usy working on the framework, they also managed to join some events throughout the year!

The Toronto Cloud Integration Meetup hosted an event in February with the overall topic "Quickly Build APIs with Existing Services and Data Using LoopBack!” Janny Hou explained what LoopBack is, what you can do with it, and the rationale behind the rewrite of the framework. Biniam Admikew demonstrated how how easy it is to expose REST API from your database with just a few steps. Jamil Spain provided an additional demo while also taking care of capturing the meetup on video. Check out the details and video [here](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/watch-meetup-quickly-build-apis-with-loopback/).



Later in the year, the LoopBack team attended CASCONxEVOKE. One of Canada’s largest combined academic, research and developer conferences, the November event offered over 150 speakers to over 1,500 attendees. Diana Lau provided an overview of the LoopBack booth and a workshop. Learn more [here](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/cascon-evoke-2019/).

### Playing Well with OpenAPI Spec

With IBM supporting the [OpenAPI Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/), it shouldn't surprise anyone that the LoopBack team uses the spec they offer.

### Downloads 

With all of this activity, we weren't surprised to see LoopBack downloads continue to grow. 

2018 
There were  approximately 1.5 millions downloads for LoopBack 2 and lb3 throughout 2018 - a 21% increase from 2017. We also saw a big increase for LoopBack 4 at 115,000 downlaods - 13 times more than last year.

### 2020 Vision

The LoopBack team is continuing to work on new features and ways to demonstrate what LoopBack 4 can do for 2019. Just as importantly, we have been encouraged as the LoopBack community continued providing feedback, reporting issues, and contributing code. We were proud and excited for LoopBack 4 GA, and now we are more excited to see where things go in 2019! 

We've just provided a very thorough summary of all LoopBack developments this year, so we recommend you started with [LoopBack 4](http://v4.loopback.io/getting-started.html) if you haven't already!
