As 2019 draws to a close, we wat to follow our annual tradition of looking at the hard work that the [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) team has achieved in the past year. LoopBack 4 was the main focus, and it is safe to say that this focus has resulted in a lot of improvements and features for the framework.

### LoopBack, Winner of 2019 API Award for API Middleware

First and foremost, it was wonderful to congratulate LoopBack for earning the 2019 API Award for the “[Best in API Middleware](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-2019-api-award-api-middleware/)” category. Celebrating the technical innovation, adoption, and reception in the API & Microservices industries and use by a global developer community, the 2019 API Awards were presented at the 2019 API Awards Ceremony during API World 2019. Raymond Feng, co-creator and architect for LoopBack, received the award.
