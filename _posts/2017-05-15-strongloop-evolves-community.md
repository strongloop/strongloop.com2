Today marks an important milestone for the StrongLoop website. It marks the transition from showcasing our services to promoting community. Previously the site showed how IBM and StrongLoop can help you power the API economy. Moving forward it embraces our role within the Open Source community and supporting the growth of that community.

## History

In March of 2013, the StrongLoop team introduced their supportable node.js solutions. We also announced our support and services for that distribution. At our launch, we announced our intention to embrace the community Node distribution and add features to improve Enterprise adoption.  We followed up with LoopBack, our Open Source node.js framework, and then StrongLoop Arc.

Over the next couple of years we continued to refine our solutions while nurturing our relationship with the Node.js community. We shared with the community at meetups, hackathons, and conventions. We teaching people about our various solutions while listening to invaluable feedback as to how to improve those solutions. We also shared informative tutorials, how to's, and overviews in our StrongBlog. This provided insight into using our solutions more effectively, but also how to more effectively use Node.js and JavaScript. Much of this blog content really struck a positive note with our developer audience, and continues to find an audience.

In September 2015, IBM acquired StrongLoop. This allowed us to innovate more quickly and increase our global market reach and customer support. Within months we introduced the world to API Connect to allow companies to enter the API economy more easily. We established a one year end of life plan for Arc as we moved its various functionalities into other products. We re-established our commitment to LoopBack as an Open Source framework, re-invigorating its documentation and continuing to add features. And, of course, making plans for upcoming revisions to LoopBack.  LoopBack.next.

All through these developments, we continued to engage the Node.js community. We attended events, learned from our users, and provided strong and useful information on our blog. StrongLoop began with a focus on the node community, but we evolved to include the open source community as well. While our means to connect with this community may have evolved, our focus and commitment has not. We're proud of how developers helped shape and grow the StrongLoop community. Moving forward, we want to continue to help promote Open Source solutions for API development. We are excited that IBM continues to contribute to and support the StrongLoop community! 

## Supporting the Open Source API Developer Community

This site will focus on open-source solutions for the API developer community. With that in mind, we will zero in on:

LoopBack, API Microgateway, and Open API Initiative - three key Open-source technologies for API creation. 

Events. The StrongLoop team will continue to sponsor and attend events because these are important to us and the community. This includes meetups, informative webinars, and developer conferences. We'll provide a list so you know where to find us!

Our blog. We are proud of the work that StrongLoop and IBM team members and members of the community have created. When we updated this site, we removed outdated posts and migrated posts to appropriate locations. Articles related to API Connect are bow located at devworks/api connect. Node-elated content has gone to  devworks/node. We will continue to provide the same strong content here, focusing on Open Source solutions.

StrongLoop newsletter. Each month we will email a summary of articles, news and announcements to help you stay in the loop. 

## The Future

We are excited to refocus on the community and streamline our website to further hone our community focus. If there are any open source solutions or events you think we should know about, let us know at:
