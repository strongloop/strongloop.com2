The [IBM API Connect](https://strongloop.com/node-js/api-connect/) team has been busy!  In March, IBM API Connect v5 was delivered, and since then we&#8217;ve made several updates and additions. Alan Ogilvie provided a thorough rundown in the IBM developerWorks forums, and we are pleased to present some of the highlights:<!--more-->

The addition of Analytics provides insight into how your API is being used._

  * _Facebook, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn, Windows Live, GitHub or Slack accounts can be used to access the Developer Portal. Or, if you have your own LDAP registry, you can use that too._
  * _We added C and C# code snippets to the examples in the Developer Portal._
  * _We made our assembly feature even cooler by making it easier to design conditional logic in your API flows, so we added a new ‘switch’ policy._
  * _We improved the integration of SOAP services in API Connect._
  * _We added the ability to define multiple rate limits (calls ‘per second’, ‘per minute’, ‘per hour’, ‘per day’ and ‘per week’) and the ability to define “burst limits” (calls ‘per second’ or ‘per minute’)._
  * _OpenAPI (Swagger 2.0) is a key technology supported by API Connect, so we made it even easier to create OpenAPI extensions from within the API Designer graphical editor._
