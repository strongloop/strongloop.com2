As we announced LoopBack 4 GA in October 2018, we have updated the Long Term Support (LTS) schedule in our [LTS page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Long-term-support.html). 


Framework | Status | Published | EOL | Runtime | GA | EOL
-- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | --
LoopBack 4 | Current | Oct 2018 | Apr 2021(minimum) | Node 10 | Oct 2018 | Apr 2021
Loopback 3 | Active LTS | Dec 2016 | Dec 2019 | Node 8 | Oct 2017 | Dec 2019
Loopback 2 | Maintenance LTS | Jul 2014 | Apr 2019 | Node 6 | Oct 2016 | Apr 2019


## If I'm a LoopBack 2 user, what should I do? 
If you're a LoopBack 2 user, you should at least migrate your LoopBack 2 applications to LoopBack 3. The effort should be minimal and the process should be smooth.  You can read more details in the [3.0 migration guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb3/Migrating-to-3.0.html). 

## If I'm a LoopBack 3 user, what should I do?
If you already have LoopBack 3 applications running in production, it is a good time for you to review the [difference between LoopBack 3 and LoopBack 4](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/LoopBack-3.x.html).  We'll be extending the EOL date for LoopBack 3, however, it is never too early to start migrating your LoopBack 3 application to LoopBack 4.  Please also note that the [feature parity gap we had identified](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/LoopBack-3.x.html). Your feedback is always appreciated! 

## If I'm a new LoopBack user, what should I do?
If you are considering to use LoopBack as your next project, LoopBack 4 is highly recommended. Check out the rationale behind of creating LoopBack 4 in which the core has been rewritten: https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Crafting-LoopBack-4.html.  

Even though we are trying to make the migration from LoopBack 3 to LoopBack 4 an easier process, the concepts and the division of responsibilities of the logical components are completely transferrable/compatible.  You can read more details in the docs page: https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/LoopBack-3.x.html.  Hence, the best approach is to start with LoopBack 4. 

(Need your input: any cases that someone should start with LoopBack 3?  Need authentication right away?)


## Would the End-of-Life dates change for LoopBack 2 and LoopBack 3? 
For LoopBack 2, the EOL life which is April 2019 will remain unchanged.  (Need to add some explanation?).

For LoopBack 3, we will be extending the EOL life date for a year, so it will be December 2020 (Note: Just my suggestion. Needs your inputs here and approval from OM). We think there is a need to extend the EOL life so that it gives us enough time for us to enhance the migration experience and for our users to migrate and provide feedback to us.
