For the past few months, we have been focusing the following stories: 
- [Authentication](#authentication): released a new `@loopback/authentication` 2.0 version.
- [Authorization](#authorization): can be enabled through interceptors as well.
- [Inclusion of related models](#inclusion_of_related_models)
- [Architectural improvements](#architectural_improvements): introduction of lifecycle observers and interceptors.
- [Migration](#migration): allows you to migrate incrementally
- [Internal tooling and CI](#internal_tooling_and_ci): Support Node.js 12, reduce build time, etc.
- [Unified web experience](#unified_web_experience): new look on the [loopback.io](https://loopback.io) web site.

We have monthly blog on what we've done in each milestone. To stay tuned, don't forget to follow us on Twitter [@StrongLoop](https://twitter.com/@StrongLoop).

### Authentication

We have recently released `@loopback/authentication` 2.0 version that includes the support of JWT and passport-based authentication. Our [shopping app example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping) has been updated to include this capability. More details can be found in this [authentication updates blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-authentication-updates/).

### Authorization

In addition to [creating an authorization component](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-component-authorization.html), you now can use intercept to add authorization to your LoopBack 4 application. [This tutorial](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/building-an-online-game-with-loopback-4-pt4/) shows how to do it from end to end.

### Inclusion of Related Models

We have set up the foundation for inclusion of related models. We made improvements in our `repository-json-schema` package to provide the base for inclusion. We updated our [`TodoList` example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/todo-list/) to describe navigational properties. The approach we used is a temporary approach to demonstrate how inclusion would work. You can clone the example to see how it works.

### Architectural Improvements

As a major architectural improvements, interceptors are introduced. Interceptors are reusable functions to provide aspect-oriented logic around method invocations.

Besides the interceptor, there is now basic life cycle support. It allows registration of life cycle observers and actions, and there are command line interface and booter to make this even easier.

Extensibility has been a great advancement for LoopBack 4. We've added decorator functions to allow you to [add extensions more easily](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Extension-point-and-extensions.html).

### Migration

If you have existing LoopBack 3 applications, it's a good time to start looking into how to migrate them to LoopBack 4. It can be done incrementally by mounting your LB3 application to LoopBack 4.  Read [this docs page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Migrating-from-LoopBack-3.html) on how to do that.


### Internal Tooling and CI

There has been a lot of enhancement in our tooling. A new major version (v2.0) of `@loopback/build` has released which we just covered it in our [June milestone blog](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-june-2019-milestone/). 

We have also introduced the concept of experimental features to LoopBack development. The goal is to be able to release experimental features quickly for early feedback while maintaining high code quality on our production-ready code. For details, see https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/labs/base/LABS.md. 

Besides, we have put tremendous effort in fixing the CI errors on the connectors, so that we can help land PRs from the community more quickly and more confidently.  We've also reduced the build time in loopback-next which improves our development efficiency.

Lastly, Node.js 12 support has been added to the LoopBack 3 and LoopBack 4 core.  The next step is to add Node.js 12 support to the connectors. 

### New Look and Feel on LoopBack Web Site
Our web site [loopback.io](https://loopback.io) now has a new look! We have moved the [LoopBack 4 web site](https://v4.loopback.io) content back to our main web site.

We have rebuilt the "Who's using LoopBack" section to showcase our users. If you would like to be a part of it, see the details in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3047).

## What's Next?
We'd like to hear from you! Our [Q3 roadmap](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/docs/ROADMAP.md) started with a pull request. We'll continue to create future roadmap in a form of PR so that you can chime in.

For the next 3 months, we'd like to focus on:
- Continue with the Q2 stories. e.g. [Authentication](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3242), [Authorization](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/538) and [Inclusion of related models](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1352).
- Feature parity gap. e.g. [Declarative support](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/2036)
- Internal tooling/infrastructure: e.g. [support Node.js 12 in connectors](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3072), [reduce build time](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3161), etc.
- Juggler-next: If time permits, we'd like to start looking into the infrastructure to prepare us to work on juggler-next.
