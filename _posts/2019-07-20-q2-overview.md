<!--more-->

### Authentication
- new authentication component that enables you for JWT and passport-based authentication
- new set of documentation and tutorials

### Authorization

- provided infrastructure to allow you to plug in your authorization logics


### Inclusion of Related Models



### Architectural Improvements
- interceptor
- anything else?

### Migration
- If you have existing LoopBack 3 application and would like to migrate to LoopBack 4, [Nora](https://strongloop.com/strongloop.com/authors/Nora_Abdelgadir/) had a blog post to cover how you can do it incrementally. https://strongloop.com/strongblog/migrate-from-loopback-3-to-loopback-4/


### Internal Tooling and CI
- reduce build time (speed up our development efficiency)
- fixes CI errors on connectors
- enable Node.js 12 support for LB4 and `loopback` module. In the coming few months, we'd like to enable Node.js 12 support for our connectors as well.
- `@loopback/build` 2.0 

### Unified Web Experience
We had finally given our web site [loopback.io](https://loopback.io) a new look.  This is to further remind you that LoopBack 4 is the active release. 


## What's Next?
We'd like to hear from you! We've created a pull request for the [upcoming roadmap](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3152). We're planning to continue posting the future roadmap in the form of PR, so that you can chime in. 

For the next 3 months, we'd like to focus on:
- Continue with the Q2 stories. e.g. [Authentication](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3242), [Authorization](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/538) and [Inclusion of related models](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1352).
- Feature parity gap. e.g. [Declarative support](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/2036)
- Internal tooling/infrastructure: e.g. [support Node.js 12 in connectors](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3072), [reduce build time](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3161), etc.
- Juggler-next: If time permits, we'd like to start looking into the infrastructure to prepare us to work on juggler-next.

## Looking for user reference
As you might be aware, we have a brand new look of the [loopback.io](https://loopback.io) web site. We'd like to rebuild the "Who's using LoopBack" section and showcase our users and the use cases. If you would like to be a part of it, see the details in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3047).
