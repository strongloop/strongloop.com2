Since LoopBack4 has [released GA version](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-ga) last October, the team has been busy in enhancing the framework, closing feature parity gaps and helping community onboard with LoopBack4. 

Thanks to the support from our community, we are seeing more than double in our monthly download numbers from [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).  We are also seeing an increase in activities from the community, in terms of answering others' questions and submitting pull requests. 

For our [Q1 roadmap](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1839), we have been focusing in implementing/enhancing the following major areas: 
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Model relations](#model-relations)


<!--more-->
### Authentication
As part of the scenario driven approach, we have added a reference implementation using JWT authentication in the [shopping example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping).  We have also worked on [design documents](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/authentication/docs) and started the implementation to enable extension points for plugging in different authentication strategies.

### Model Relations
Besides `hasMany` and `belongsTo`, we have added one more relation type [`hasOne`](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/hasOne-rela
tion.html).  Thanks to the community contribution, there are design discussion on other relation types, such as `hasManyThrough`.  Besides, the command line interface for relation `lb4 relation` contributed by a group of community users are on the way! 

### User Adoption

As LoopBack is a Node.js framework, we also look at the common use cases that Node.js developers do.  One of the feedback we go is whether it is possible to use JavaScript, instead of TypeScript, in LoopBack 4.  We did some investigation and posted a [blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback4-javascript-experience/) recently. 

- Mounting Express middleware to LoopBack app

### Experimental

- PoCs on integration with Kafka and socket.io
- others?
