After LoopBack4 has [released GA version](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-ga) last October, the train didn't stop. The team has been busy in enhancing the framework, closing feature parity gaps and helping community onboard with LoopBack4.

Since GA, we have been focusing in implementing/enhancing the following major areas: 
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Model relations](#model-relations)
- [Migration](#migration)
- [Extensibility](#extensibility)

Many thanks to your support and contributions, we are seeing more than double in our monthly download numbers in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) since GA. We are also seeing an increase in activities from the community, in terms of answering others' questions and submitting pull requests. For the last 3 months, more than 15% of the merged pull requests are coming from the community. New to open source contribution? Don't worry, this [step by step guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/submitting_a_pr.html) will guide you through.

Let's take a closer look at each epic. 

### Authentication
As part of the scenario driven approach, we have added a reference implementation using JWT authentication in the [shopping example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping). We have also worked on a more [detailed design](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/authentication/docs) and started the implementation to enable extension points for plugging in different authentication strategies.

### Model Relations

Besides `hasMany` and `belongsTo`, we have added one more relation type [`hasOne`](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/hasOne-relation.html). We received lots of interests around other relation types, such as `hasManyThrough`.  Some of you had implemented the command line interface for creating model relations (`lb4 relation`).  It's on the way! 

### Migration

We've done some investigation to improve the developer experience for migrating LoopBack 3 applications to LoopBack 4.  One of the goals is to allow you to migrate your application incrementally.  We have done the following spikes on:
- [mounting entire LoopBack 3 application as external routed on LoopBack 4](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/2389)
- dropping LoopBack 3 models to LoopBack 4 app

_Miroslav, I think there are more spikes/github issues related to that. Could you please help with the content? thanks!_


Earlier this year, we have made the announcement to extend the long term support for LoopBack 3.  If you're using an older LoopBack versions, don't miss [this blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/lb3-extended-lts/). 


### Extensibility

One of our goals for LoopBack 4 is to build a minimal core while enabling everything else to be implemented via extensions. We continued to enhance the extensibility of the framework. We have introduced `context.view` and related events and added [`greeter-extension` example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/greeter-extension).  Lifecycle support and binding configuration/injection is coming soon. 

### User Adoption

As LoopBack is a Node.js framework, we've looked at the common use cases that Node.js developers do so as to think of ways to make your adoption to LoopBack easier. Receiving feedback from various sources, we have:
- investigated the possibility to use JavaScript when developing LoopBack 4 applications. Check out our recent [blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback4-javascript-experience/) for details.
- added [an example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/express-composition) on how to mount Express middleware to LoopBack application.


### Experimental

- PoCs on integration with Kafka, GraphQL, socket.io

_Raymond, could you please add details here?_

- Spikes on "Inclusion of related models" and on how to describe PATCH payload in OpenAPI spec.
