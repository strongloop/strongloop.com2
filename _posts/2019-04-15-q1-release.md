After LoopBack4 has [released GA version](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-ga) last October, the train didn't stop. The team has been busy enhancing the framework, closing feature parity gaps, and helping community onboard with LoopBack4.

Since GA, we have been focusing on implementing/enhancing the following major areas: 
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Model relations](#model-relations)
- [Migration](#migration)
- [Extensibility](#extensibility)

Many thanks to your support and contributions, we are seeing more than double in our monthly download numbers in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/) since GA. We are also seeing an increase in activities from the community, in terms of answering others' questions and submitting pull requests. For the last 3 months, more than 15% of the merged pull requests are coming from the community. New to open source contribution? Don't worry, this [step by step guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/submitting_a_pr.html) will guide you through the contribution process.

Let's take a closer look at each epic. 

### Authentication
As part of the scenario driven approach, we have added a reference implementation using JWT authentication in the [shopping example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping). We have also worked on a more [detailed design](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/authentication/docs) and started the implementation to enable extension points for plugging in different authentication strategies.

### Model Relations

Besides `hasMany` and `belongsTo`, we have added one more relation type [`hasOne`](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/hasOne-relation.html). We received lots of interests around other relation types, such as `hasManyThrough`.  Some of you had implemented the command line interface for creating model relations (`lb4 relation`).  It's on the way! 

### Migration

We've done some investigation to improve the developer experience for migrating LoopBack 3 applications to LoopBack 4.  One of the goals is to allow you to migrate your application incrementally.  We have done the following spikes on:
- [mount Express router with OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/2389)
- [mount an LoopBack 3 app and include its REST API in OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/2318)

Earlier this year, we have made the announcement to extend the long term support for LoopBack 3.  If you're using an older LoopBack version, don't miss [this blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/lb3-extended-lts/). 


### Extensibility

One of our goals for LoopBack 4 is to build a minimal core while enabling everything else to be implemented via extensions. We continued to enhance the extensibility of the framework. We have introduced `context.view` and related events and added [`greeter-extension` example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/greeter-extension).  Lifecycle support and binding configuration/injection is coming soon. 

### User Adoption

As LoopBack is a Node.js framework, we've looked at the common use cases that Node.js developers do so as to think of ways to make your adoption to LoopBack easier. Receiving feedback from various sources, we have:
- investigated the possibility to use JavaScript when developing LoopBack 4 applications. Check out our recent [blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback4-javascript-experience/) for details.
- added [an example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/express-composition) on how to mount Express middleware to a LoopBack application.


### Experimental

Before implementing a more complicated feature, we find out starting it with a spike forces us to give more thoughts to our design and other alternatives.  Recently, we completed the spikes for [inclusion of relation models](add-link) and [partial updates](add-link).

On top of the features mentioned in the above stories, we are always looking for using and/or integrating with popular technologies.  Here are a list of experimental features we're working on:

- [Kafka](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-kafka)
- [Socket.io](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2648)
- [Native support of GraphQL](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2670)
- [OpenAPI connector](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-connector-openapi/pull/2)
- [gRPC extension](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-extension-grpc)
- [Support for method interceptors](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2687)

While we want to make sure high quality of code goes into our codebase which may take multiple iterations, we're looking for ways to release experimental features so that our users can take a peek earlier and give early feedback. Looking for your feedback on how we can roll out the experimental features: https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/2676.

## What's Next
Going forward, we will continue to improve the migration experience, close feature parity gaps and bring compelling features to you.  Please see the [Q2 roadmap](add-link) for our plan.
