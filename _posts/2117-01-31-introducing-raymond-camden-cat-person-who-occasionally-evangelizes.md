_**Editor&#8217;s Note:** This month we&#8217;ve been introducing you to IBMâ€™s StrongLoop Developer Evangelist team. While they are usually quite busy attending events, hosting webinars, and putting together content about LoopBack and IBM&#8217;s API Connect, we managed to get them to write about themselves and let us know more about them. We&#8217;ve already told you about [David Okun](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/introducing-david-okun-strongloop-developer-evangelist/), [Erin McKean](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/introducing-erin-mckean-strongloop-lead-developer-evangelist/) and [Joe Sepi](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/my-friends-call-me-joe-sepi-and-you-can-too/). Today we wrap up our introductions with our veteran evangelist, Raymond Camden._

Hi, you may know me from that post about I did with [cats in the demo](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/working-with-file-storage-and-loopback/) &#8211; no &#8211; not that one &#8211; the [other one](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/building-javascript-charts-powered-by-loopback/). Or maybe it was [this one](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/working-with-geographical-data-in-your-api/)? No matter &#8211; obviously I have a thing for cats in demos. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve been properly introduced, so let me take this time to tell you a little bit about me.
  
<!--more-->

I began my career building basic web sites back in 94 or so (remind me to tell you horror stories of what it was like back then &#8211; thank your deity of choice for dev tools) and moved mainly into server-side development for a good ten to fifteen years. (For folks curious, this was in ColdFusion, a proprietary closed-source app server that was darn easy to use at the time, and well worth the cost imo.)

Over the past decade or though I&#8217;ve been refocusing my attention to the web, and web standards, in general. I&#8217;ve fallen back in love with JavaScript (again, I can tell you horror stories of the LiveScript days) and find Node to be a great way to build servers.

However, I didn&#8217;t like Node at first. I can remember sitting in on &#8220;Intro to NodeJS&#8221; talks where all we did after an hour was build a web server!

Finally I sat in a session where [Express](http://expressjs.com/) was used and it was a game changer. I finally saw myself using Node and (slowly) weaned myself off of ColdFusion as much as possible.

I felt much the same way about [LoopBack](http://loopback.io). It was such a great way of simplifying the CRUD/boring aspects of API building that I wanted to build an API for everything and anything. (If I could hook up little Node servers to my cats, I would.)

As an evangelist, developer advocate, whatever you want to call it, I feel like my job is to share my pain with others to (hopefully) prevent your pain. I&#8217;ve been running my [personal blog](https://www.raymondcamden.com) for near 15 years now, and nearly every single one of my blog posts is simply me figuring out something on my own and then sharing that with others. Learning comes slowly for me &#8211; so when I do finally get something figured out, I write it down and share it.

Outside of that &#8211; I&#8217;m an adoptive father of six (yes, seriously) kids. Three from South Korea and three from China. Did I mention I have an awesome wife, too? I&#8217;ve also got something of a mild Star Wars obsession going on as well, but that&#8217;s totally sensible for a person of my age.
