Some commonly asked questions at the IBM booth regarding LoopBack.  

**Q: What is LoopBack?**

A: LoopBack is a leading open source Node.js API framework. Continued to be the leading API creation framework with out-of-box integration with 20+ databases and services, LoopBack 4:
- Has a brand new core rewritten in TypeScript which makes this framework simpler to use and easier to extend than ever
- Supports OpenAPI for comprehensive bottom-up and top-down REST API experience
- Enables instant GraphQL endpoints from REST APIs


**Q: I missed the LoopBack workshop.  Can I find the lab instructions somewhere?**

A: Of course! You can find the tutorial here: https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/create-rest-apis-minutes-with-loopback-4/.

**Q: Can I use LoopBack to talk to other third-party services?**

A: Yes, you can connect to external services, such as REST and SOAP services, in your LoopBack application.  See [the documentation page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Calling-other-APIs-and-web-services.html) and [the SOAP calculator tutorial](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/soap-calculator-tutorial.html) for more details.

**Q: I heard that LoopBack has GraphQL support.  Can you tell me more about it?**

A: We recently released a node module called [oasgraph](http://v4.loopback.io/oasgraph.html). It takes any REST API with an OpenAPI definition and give it a GraphQL gateway. [Our tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/create-rest-apis-minutes-with-loopback-4/) shows you how.

**Q: What if I missed the talk on building large scale Node.js application?**

A: Don't worry.  The recording has been posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6td2GaW3I&index=35&list=PLfMzBWSH11xaZvhv1X5Fq1H-oMdnAtG6k&t=0s).  Other presentation recordings can be found [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfMzBWSH11xaZvhv1X5Fq1H-oMdnAtG6k) as well.
