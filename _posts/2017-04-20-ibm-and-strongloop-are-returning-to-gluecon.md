We&#8217;re happy to announce that IBM and StrongLoop are returning to GlueCon. The StrongLoop team will be heading to Broomfield, CO from May 24-26, 2017 for this technical conference.

Never been to Gluecon? The convention describes itself like this:

_Glue is a developerÂ­ oriented conference that is focused on how Serverless Architectures, Containers, Microservices, APIs, DevOps, Mobile, Analytics, Performance Monitoring, and cutting edge developer platforms and tools are changing the technology landscape._
