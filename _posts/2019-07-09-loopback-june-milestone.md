As the temperature gets warmer the LoopBack team is spending this summer releasing hot deliverables. In June we focused on various enhancements such as releasing version 2.0.0 of `@loopback/build`, replacing `strong-docs`, and improving `@loopback/testlab`. We also focused on authentication, inclusion of related models, and other improvements. You can see the [June milestone](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3035) for an overview of what we have worked on, and read on for more details.

## Version 2.0.0 of `@loopback/build`

In the past months, we have significantly evolved our build tooling. The last major change was the switch from `tslint` to `eslint` for linting. We decided it's time to clean up the code, remove unused parts and release a new major version.

The release introduced the following breaking changes:

- `lb-apidocs` helper is no longer available.
- `lb-tslint` helper is no longer available.
- `lb-tsc` is no longer choosing `outDir` for you, you have to specify it explicitly.
- It is no longer possible to the specify compilation target via a non-option argument like `lb-tsc es2017`.

See the [release notes](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/packages/build/CHANGELOG.md#200-2019-06-17) for more details and instructions on migrating your existing projects.

As part of these changes, we removed vulnerable dependencies and thus `npm install` in newly scaffolded projects reports zero vulnerabilities ðŸŽ‰.

## Replacing `strong-docs` with `tsdocs`

In [PR#3055](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3055), we replaced `strong-docs` with `@loopback/tsdocs`. We use `@loopback/tsdocs` to generate markdown files on our website. With this change, we changed the home for our API docs; you can visit the [new home](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/apidocs.index.html) on our website to see the docs. 

This change was a breaking change: as mentioned before, `lb-apidocs` is no longer available for use, as it was removed as part of this PR. For alternate solutions, you can use Microsoft's [api-extractor](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/api-extractor) and [api-documenter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/api-documenter).

On the brighter side, by removing `strong-docs` we also removed dependencies on 3rd party modules that have known security vulnerabilities but are no longer maintained.

## Jest and `@loopback/testlab`

We improved our testing helpers to support Jest testing framework.

- [PR#3013](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3013) fixed typings for `itSkippedOnTravis` to remove an implicit dependency on Mocha typings, which was causing conflicts when using our testlab from Jest.

- [PR#3040](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3040) introduced a more generic helper `skipOnTravis` which supports any BDD verbs like `describe` and `it`.

    ```ts
    skipOnTravis(it, 'does something', async () => {
      // the test code
    });
    ```

- [PR#3138](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3138) added even more generic helper `skipIf` that allows you to skip a test case or a test suite on arbitrary condition.

    ```ts
    skipIf(someCondition, it, 'does something', async () => {
      // the test code
    });
    ```

We are also looking into ways to migrate our test suite from Mocha to Jest. Stay tuned for updates!

## Authentication 

In [PR#120](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping/pull/120), the [shopping cart application](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping) was updated to utilize the latest authentication package `@loopback/authentication2.x`. You can read more about our latest authentication package in our blog [What's New in LoopBack 4 Authentication 2.0](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-authentication-updates/).

In [PR#2977](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2977), we introduced some new documentation to the authentication package we've been updating these past few months. See [Authentication](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-component-authentication.html) for details.

In [PR#3046](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3046), a new authentication tutorial on [How to secure your LoopBack 4 application with JWT authentication](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Authentication-Tutorial.html) was added.

We released the new adapter for passport-based strategies as [`@loopback/authentication-passport`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loopback/authentication-passport); now you can follow the guide in [Use Passport-based Strategies](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Loopback-component-authentication.html) to learn how to create and register a passport strategy and plug it into the authentication system.

## Inclusion of Related Models

### `getJsonSchema` Enhancement

A community user, [@samarpanB](https://github.com/samarpanB), has contributed [PR#2975](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2975) adding a new option `includeRelations` to the helper `getJsonSchema`. When the option is enabled, the helper adds navigational properties for inclusion of related models in the emitted model schema.

### Navigation Properties Added to TodoList Example

As part of our [Inclusion of Related Models Epic](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1352), we updated our [TodoList example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/todo-list) to also include navigational properties. After the work done in [PR#3171](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3171), now when getting a `Todo` with an inclusion filter, its included `TodoList` will be a part of the response and vice versa.

When you call `GET todos/2`, you get the following response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Take over the galaxy",
  "desc": "MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAMWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",
  "todoListId": 1
}
```

And now when you call `GET todos/2` with the filter `{include: [{relation: 'todo-lists'}]}`, you get the following response:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Take over the galaxy",
  "desc": "MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAMWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",
  "todoListId": 1,
  "todoList": {
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Sith lord's check list"
  }
}
```

You can check out the new full example by calling `lb4 example todo-list`.

## Partial Updates via `PATCH`

In [PR#3199](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3199), we enabled added a `partial` option for `JsonSchemaOptions`. This addition allowed us to emit schema where all the model properties are optional. By doing this, this lets us to now do `PATCH` requests without having to include all required properties in the request body.

For example, before when trying to update a `Todo` from our [`Todo` example](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/examples/todo), you'd have to include the `title` property in the request body:

`PATCH todos/1`

```json
{
   "title": "Take over the galaxy", 
   "desc": "get the resources ready" 
}
```

But now even though `title` is still required, it is optional when doing a `PATCH` request. So now the following is a valid request body to pass to the following request:

`PATCH todos/1`

```json
{
   "desc": "get the resources ready" 
}
```

All newly created projects generated through the CLI will allow partial updates through `PATCH`.

## New GitHub Issue Templates

In [PR#3202](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3202), we updated the GitHub issues template, so that when you open a new issue, you're taken to [a page](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/new/choose) (see image below) where you can choose the type of issue to open. The options we offer are: bug report, feature request, question, and security vulnerability. With these new more specific templates, it will be easier for the team to go through and understand new issues.

## CLI Improvement

In [PR#2989](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2989), we made some improvements to the CLI:

- Changed/unified the naming convention to eliminate bugs causing by the input. See the [naming conventions](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Command-line-interface.html#naming-convention) we follow in LoopBack 4.
- Added a prompt message to warn/notify users the change to their inputs and file names in advance. For example:
    ```
    $ lb4 controller
    ? Controller class name: todo
    $ Controller Todo will be created in src/controllers/todo.controller.ts
    ```

We also made some fixes to our `lb4 discover` command: 

- In [PR#3127](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3127), we fixed a bug so that the prompt exits properly when using the command.
- In [PR#3015](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3015/), community member [@samarpanB](https://github.com/samarpanB) contributed a fix that would properly stringify `modelSettings` that go into the `@model` decorator.
- In [PR#3115](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3115), community member [@marvinirwin](https://github.com/marvinirwin) contributed a fix that makes the `schema` field in `modelSettings` use the owner of the schema.

## New Team Member

We have a new addition to our LoopBack team: Agnes ([@agnes512 on GitHub](https://github.com/agnes512)) has joined the team as our intern for the next year. She has already contributed improvements to our documentation, our [`cloudant` connector](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-connector-cloudant/), our CLI, and other more. We're happy to have her on our team and look forward to see what she accomplishes in the future.

## Other Changes

- We introduced a shared test suite that allows us to test any Repository implementation against any supported connector, e.g. `DefaultCrudRepository` against `loopback-connector-mongodb`. This suite will help us to catch database-specific problems that went undiscovered so far. See [PR#3097](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3079).
- We reworked the `cloudant` connector test setup so that both juggler versions 3.x and 4.x are triggered. So far connectors `mongodb`, `postgresql`, `kv-redis`, `cloudant` run the shared tests. See [PR#206](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-connector-cloudant/pull/206).
- We honoured the arguments for another two LoopBack 3 CLI commands: `lb remote-method` and `lb middleware`. See [PR#410](https://github.com/strongloop/generator-loopback/pull/410).
- We deprecated the `@loopback/openapi-v3-types` package. See [PR#3220](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/3220).
- We improved the documentation for our [shopping cart application](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping). See [PR#183](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-shopping/pull/183).

We have finished the migration from GreenKeeper to RenovateBot and added documentation for LoopBack developers describing how to work with RenovateBot's pull requests. Learn more in the new section [Renovate bot](https://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/code-contrib-lb4.html#renovate-bot) in our documentation for developers.

We have upgraded our eslint-related infrastructure to eslint version 6 and added few more rules to the default eslint config to catch even more programming errors:

- [no-floating-promise](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin/docs/rules/no-floating-promises.md) to detect & reject usage of Promise-like values in statements without handling their errors appropriately. We used to have this rule enabled in our old tslint-based setup but had to switch it temporarily off because it was not available in typescript-eslint until recently.
- [no-prototype-builtins](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-prototype-builtins) to detect code that can introduce Prototype Poisoning vulnerability. This rule was promoted to recommended rules in eslint version 6.
- [require-atomic-updates](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/require-atomic-updates) to report assignments to variables or properties where a race condition may be introduced. This rule was promoted to recommended rules in eslint version 6.

## Looking for User References

As you might be aware, the [loopback.io](https://loopback.io/) website has a brand new look. We'd like to rebuild the "Who's using LoopBack" section and showcase our users and their use cases. If you would like to be a part of it, see the details in this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/3047).
