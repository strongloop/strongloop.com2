Fall is the season of the harvest. We're glad to see the good progress that we've made in the past 3 months, together with the contributions from the community. In September, there is record high percentage (25.6%) of the merged PRs which are coming from the community. Thank you all!

If you haven't heard of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) happening this month, check out the details in our [previous blog on Hacktoberfest](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/2020-hacktoberfest/). There's still time to join. For those who participated, we appreciated your contributions. 

Let's take a look some of the highlights in the last quarter by you and the LoopBack team.

## Integrate with TypeORM, TypeGraphQL and MessagePack

One of our strategies to add value to LoopBack is to leverage third-party libraries and integrate with them. We created the following extensions:

- [`@loopback/typeorm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loopback/typeorm): enables [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) support in LoopBack
- [`@loopback/graphql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loopback/graphql): integrates with [TypeGraphQL](https://typegraphql.com/) for creating GraphQL API https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/GraphQL.html
- [`@loopback/rest-msgpack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@loopback/rest-msgpack): adds support to allow receive [MessagePack](https://msgpack.org/index.html) requests and transparently convert it to a regular JavaScript object. It provides a BodyParser implementation and a component to register it. 


## Reorganize and Enhance Documentation

To better organize our content and easier for navigation/discovery, we reorganized our content based on [four quadrants](https://documentation.divio.com): tutorials, how-to guides, concepts and reference guides. To find out more how our documentation is organized, see [this documentation page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/#how-is-our-documentation-organized).

Besides the ongoing [refactoring work](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/5783), we enriched the content and clarified on some of the topics that are frequently asked by you. For example, we:
- [cleaned up the documentation about LoopBack extension](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Extending-LoopBack-4.html) so that your extension creation experience would be easier and smoother. We'll continue to make some more improvement in this area as well. 
- enhanced the content for [authentication](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Authentication-overview.html) and [authorization](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Authorization-overview.html) to include basic concepts, usage and examples. 
- added a section on [accessing multiple models inside a transaction](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Using-database-transactions.html#accessing-multiple-models-inside-one-transaction)

## Other Key Feature Highlights

There were many features, fixes and enhancements in the past few months, and here are some highlights:
- completed the [HasManyThrough relation](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/HasManyThrough-relation.html)
- [improved REST experience](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/august-2020-milestone/#improving-rest-experience) by adding a [middleware based sequence](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/REST-middleware-sequence.html)
- added [support for applying multiple authentication strategies to one endpoint](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Authentication-component-decorator.html)
- implemented the [refresh token service](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/extensions/authentication-jwt#endpoints-with-refresh-token) in the `@loopback/authentication-jwt` extension
- added the [support of OpenAPI parameter AJV validation](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6285) on simple types and [AJV formats for OpenAPI spec data type formats](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/6262).

## Encourage Community Contributions

In a [recent blog post](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/2020-community-contribution/), we shared our views on encouraging more community contributions to match with our growing user community. The [switch to Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/code-contrib.html#developer-certificate-of-origin-dco) as the contribution method is a change we made to make your contribution process easier. We also created a [community extension documentation page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Community-extensions.html) to showcase LoopBack extensions built by the community. 

In addition, we are pleased to have [@nabdelgadir](https://github.com/nabdelgadir) and [@madaky](https://github.com/madaky) to be one of our community maintainers. We appreciate the great work youâ€™ve done and welcome to the team.
