Let's start with a backstory - in 2010, my dad, [Robert Okun](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertokun/) and I started using an Excel spreadsheet to see who could correctly predict the outcome of more NFL games on a weekly basis. This caught on quite easily, and we've kept the game going since then. Along the way we made  some additions to the game rules, trackers, points, and so on. Needless to say, the Excel spreadsheet has become a little, uh, let's call it cumbersome.

After the 2016 season ended, I mentioned that using the Excel sheet to manage this game was getting a bit old. I also brought up that it would be interesting if we could get more people to play this game, but not have to manage everything by ourselves. Finally, I thought about how much fun it could be to play this from either a website or a mobile app.

You do know where I'm going with this, don't you? Something like [LoopBack](https://loopback.io) sure would be easy to get this up and running.

Sure enough, the talk turned to reality, and something exciting is underway. My dad now works for [The SilverLogic](https://tsl.io) as their Chief Business Development Officer, and he and [David Hartmann, CEO](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hartmanndavid/) have put a vision in place to make this a fully-playable and open source (!!!) game in time for the 2017 NFL Season. The SilverLogic (TSL) is a full service software engineering firm based out of South Florida, working with clients on unique ways to leverage mobile and web technology to make your life easier. Check out their portfolio [here](https://tsl.io/portfolio/).

Along with using LoopBack, [Kitura](http://kitura.io), and [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/), TSL are working hard on a base application called *BaseApp* accelerating rapid development of iOS and Android applications, which they plan to open source as part of this release.

> "We've been working on improving BaseApp over the past two and a half years using it to give our clients a head-start when choosing to develop their technology with us. We figured our recent release of v2 along with collaborating on PicksApp with IBM would be a great opportunity to finally take the step to share BaseApp with the open source community." - David Hartmann, CEO, The SilverLogic

I think this is going to be a really fun game to play. I've played fantasy football and other things of that nature before, but this was always super easy to play, and pretty fun to do in a group, even if it is SportsBall™ related. Nonetheless, it was tough to keep track of on a spreadsheet, and it's really exciting to see TSL take such ownership in making this turn to a reality. There's even an ongoing discussion around getting Watson involved as someone to play against!

TSL are planning to release the first version of the app on iOS by the end of this month, to allow enough time for **all** of the downloads to happen before the season starts. It'll be totally free, and you'll be able to watch the game get made in real time [here](this would be a good spot to put the github link if what we have is ready to open source). Being open source, I'm positive that TSL would love contributors to come on board and help get it up to speed.

## What's next?

If you want to make a backend application just like XtraPoints, go see how you can have an API up and running in five minutes [here](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/2017/03/09/loopback-in-5-minutes/).
