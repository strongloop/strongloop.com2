The initial Node+JS Interactive has wrapped up and the event went quite nicely. Mind you, the event was at the same location as 2017's [Node Interactive](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-interactive-2017-wrap-up/), and the result of merging Node Interactive and JS Interactive, so we were confident it was going to be a hit.

The event, hosted at the Vancouver Convention Centre in British Columbia, Canada, ran from October 10-12. IBM had served as was Platinum Sponsor for prior Node Interactives, and was proud to act as one of the Platinum Sponsors for Node+JS Interactive as well.

The Center rests in Vancouverâ€™s idyllic waterfront, with water, forest and mountain providing beautiful scenery to engage visitors. And while the majestic beauty was a nice distraction, it was node.js and JavaScript that the attendees came to experience. And there was a bounty, so we will only be providing an overview below.
