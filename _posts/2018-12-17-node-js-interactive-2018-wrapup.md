The initial Node+JS Interactive has wrapped up and the event went quite nicely. Mind you, the event was at the same location as 2017's [Node Interactive](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/node-interactive-2017-wrap-up/), and the result of merging Node Interactive and JS Interactive, so we were confident it was going to be a hit.

The event, hosted at the Vancouver Convention Centre in British Columbia, Canada, ran from October 10-12. IBM had served as was Platinum Sponsor for prior Node Interactives, and was proud to act as one of the Platinum Sponsors for Node+JS Interactive as well.

The Center rests in Vancouverâ€™s idyllic waterfront, with water, forest and mountain providing beautiful scenery to engage visitors. And while the majestic beauty was a nice distraction, it was node.js and JavaScript that the attendees came to experience. And there was a bounty, so we will only be providing an overview below.

While we wait for event videos to be posted, there were a couple of sessions that really stood out. 

The first was one of the the keynotes that launched the event, presented by April Wensel. Wensel is the Founder of  "Compassionate Coding", and broke down stereotypes of developers in "Programmers Don't Like People...or Do They?" While examining the various behaviours that programmers may exhibit, she stated "I don't believe in having role models, I believe in modeling specific behaviors that have an impact." She contrasted this with the alternative, stating, "Rather than worshiping an entire person who is flawed and will do toxic things as well". Overall, the session helped us get a better understanding of how we can all make a contribution to community culture.

Speaking of community, another interesting session was at the location dubbed "Community Corner." There, IBM's Gireesh Punathil presented "Effectively Leverage nodejs/help Repo". It provided a run-through of best practices to utilise the nodejs/help repo with best practices. A good approach - look at what your expected outcome is and how problems may emerge with your code snippet.

We were excited to have LoopBack 4 officially announced by Chris Bailey, IBM's Chief Architect of Cloud Native Runtimes. He mentioned it was live in his "Create, Deploy and Scale: Building Enterprise Grade Cloud Native Node.js APIs" keynote. Then, LoopBack developer (and one of StrongLoop's founders) Raymond Feng provided a wlakthrough of LoopBack 4 in his session "
The Art of Building Node.js Projects at Scale." 

The Booth Crawl is always a great opportunity to see what other people - and businesses - or doing with Node and JavaScript. Plenty of people visited the IBM booth with questions, and appetizers and drinks made the conversation go a little more smoothly.

The event officially wrapped up Thursday evening at the event afterparty, hosted by Telus at Vancouver's Telus Garden.
