Want to attend the premier enterprise app developers conference? We're heading to [Cloud Foundry Summit](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/event/summit-silicon-valley-2017/) in Silicon Valley, and we hope you will join us!

We’re going to have our own booth. I thought maybe we could help cross promote the journey from strongblog if we write a post, since we’ll be demo’ing that, and help her out with the promotion

ld say we’re demoing the journey, speaking about lb, and that ibm is sponsoring the node track)

Join StrongLoop and IBM at InterConnect 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada! The event runs from March 19-23, and the StrongLoop team will once again unite with the larger IBM team at InterConnect. We look forward to helping people discover and learn about options for the Cloud, the Internet of Things, Watson, and more. And, of course, discovering and learning more about those things ourselves.<!--more-->



If you haven&#8217;t heard of InterConnect, the event site does a great job of telling you what to expect:

_&#8220;It’s time to put yourself in the driver’s seat, where your data works for you and open is your religion. Explore artificial intelligence, security, Internet of Things and cognitive — all on the IBM Cloud.&#8221;_
