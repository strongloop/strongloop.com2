We are excited to announce three new free webcasts for June!

This series will focus on Open Source solutions - in this case OpenWhisk and LoopBack. Check out the topics and dates below, and be sure to register for all three!
 
## June 7, 2017: [Go Serverless with OpenWhisk](https://engage.vevent.com/index.jsp?eid=556&seid=90389)

Serverless is an exciting new way for developers to set up a backend. 

Join Developer Advocate Raymond Camden as he explains what exactly Serverless is, and also what it isn't. Gain insight to its potential uses, deployment and optimization.

In addition Raymond will cover the open source OpenWhisk project and will demo how the IBM Bluemix platform makes Serverless easier than ever to adopt through features like Native API Management support.

To sum up: less management, more code, what can go wrong with that?

{% include image.html file='2017/LoopBack-Unlockenterprise.jpg' alt='Unlock Enterprise Data with APIs Using LoopBack with Sai Vennam' %}

Join Developer Evangelist Sai Vennam on June 13 to learn how Acme Freight, a fictional logistics company, uses LoopBack to create and expose APIs for enterprise data and API Connect to secure and manage their APIs.

With LoopBack, Acme Freight was able to create an application that integrates with their existing ERP system and use API Connect to secure their data via a managed API.

The open source API framework LoopBack can be used for many development use cases, from proof of concept to microservices implementations. It can help developers rapidly create REST APIs for any use case, from PoC's to microservices implementations.
