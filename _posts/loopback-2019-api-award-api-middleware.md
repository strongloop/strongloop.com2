Company Announcement: 


We’re excited to announce that IBM has won an 2019 API Award in the category: Best in API Middleware. The 2019 API Awards celebrate the technical innovation, adoption and reception in the API & Microservices industries and use by a global developer community. The 2019 API Awards will be presented at the 2019 API Awards Ceremony during the first day of API World 2019 (Oct 8-10, 2019, San Jose Convention Center), the world’s largest API & Microservices conference & expo -- the largest event for the API economy -- in its 8th year, with over 3,500 attendees. 


The 2019 API Awards received hundreds of nominations, and the Advisory Board to the API Awards selected our product/technology based on three criteria: (1) attracting notable attention and awareness in the API industry; (2) general regard and use by the developer & engineering community; and (3) being a leader in its sector for innovation. 


IBM is a shining example of the API technologies now empowering developers & engineers to build upon the backbone of the multi-trillion-dollar market for API-driven products and services. Today’s cloud-based software and hardware increasingly runs on an open ecosystem of API-centric architecture, and IBM’s win here at the 2019 API Awards is evidence of their leading role in the growth of the API Economy,” said Jonathan Pasky, Executive Producer & Co-Founder of DevNetwork, producer of API Word & the 2019 API Awards.
