LoopBack 3 is [approaching its end-of-life](https://loopback.io/doc/en/contrib/Long-term-support.html) at the end of the year for community support. For LoopBack 3 users, we hope the [migration guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/migration-overview.html) helps you migrate your applications to version 4. 

<!--more-->

At the same time, we understand you might still be using LoopBack 3 and/or in the process of migrating to LoopBack 4. For the next few months after the EOL date, we'll try to support the community in the following ways:

- **Helping the community to migrate**: we will continue to help with questions on [GitHub](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback) and [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/loopbackio/shared_invite/zt-8lbow73r-SKAKz61Vdao~_rGf91pcsw), but it will be on a best-effort basis.
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Critical security fixes will be applied as needed by [IBM API Connect](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/api-connect).
- **New features**: No features will be accepted.
- **Bugs**: We are not going to actively fix any bugs reported by the community users. For critical bugs, maintainers will review and assess the risks of community-submitted PRs. If you’re planning to submit a fix, it’s the best to open a GitHub issue to discuss with the maintainers before proceeding.

Please note that the December 2020 end-of-life date is applicable to community support. If you are using LoopBack as part of the [IBM API Connect](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/api-connect) v5 or v2018 product, check with the product announcement for its end-of-support schedule.

## What Should I Do If I'm Still Using LoopBack 3?

If you already have LoopBack 3 applications running in production, it is highly recommended for you to review the [Understanding the differences between LoopBack 3 and LoopBack 4 page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Understanding-the-differences.html) as mentioned in [one of our older blog posts](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/lb3-extended-lts/). There is also the [migration guide](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/migration-overview.html) helping you to migrate your LoopBack 3 applications incrementally.

## What If I Cannot Migrate to LoopBack 4 Any Time Soon?

Your LoopBack 3 applications will continue to work even after LoopBack 3 reaches end of life. There will be _very_ minimal, if any, changes going into the codebase. In the case of addressing security vulnerabilities, you might need to fork the corresponding GitHub repos and apply security fixes. See [this blog](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/lb3-entered-maintenance-mode/) for the list of Node.js packages reaching end-of-life along with `loopback` repo.
