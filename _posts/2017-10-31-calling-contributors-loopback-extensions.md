As you might know already, we're wrapping up on the LoopBack4 Core Beta release.  We are now calling out to our LoopBack community users (especially @strongloop/loopback-next) to develop LB extensions!
 
How it works ##

Tell us ###

Let us know which extension you'd like to build.  Here is the wish list voted by the community: [#512](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/512).

Examples of LB extensions:
- Authentication: [https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/authentication](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/tree/master/packages/authentication)
- Log extension: [https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-log-extension](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback4-example-log-extension) (currently in dev branch)

Build it ###

One of the LB project maintainers will be assigned to you to walk you through the whole journey of creating an extension from the beginning till the end.

Get recognized ###

We'll broadcast your work in our web site and social media!
