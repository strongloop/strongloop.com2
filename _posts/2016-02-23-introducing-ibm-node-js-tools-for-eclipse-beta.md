  * NPM and Node Inspector launch support.
  * JavaScript editing and validation with integrated Tern.java content assist services supporting ECMAScript 6 (ES6), and many popular JS frameworks.
  * Convenient Node.js project wizard supporting several quickstart templates including Express and Loopback.
