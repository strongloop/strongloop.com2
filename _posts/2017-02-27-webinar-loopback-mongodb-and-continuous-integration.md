Considering using LoopBack to create an API for your data in MongoDB? Then mark your calendars! We have a new webinar coming up on Tuesday March 28th &#8211; &#8220;LoopBack, MongoDB, and Continuous Integration&#8221;.

LoopBack is a great tool for quickly generating a CRUD API for your data stored in MongoDB. In this webinar, we will walk through setting up a continuous integration pipeline with tests, and show a few different deployment options.
