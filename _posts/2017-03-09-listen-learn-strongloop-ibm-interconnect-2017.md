Last week, we announced that we would be at [IBM InterConnect](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/join-strongloop-ibm-interconnect-2017/). We told you then that we were looking forward to helping people discover and learn about options for the Cloud, the Internet of Things, Watson, and more. Today we&#8217;re happy to share what the StrongLoop Evangelist team will be talking about at IBM InterConnect 2017. Get full details on what they will be talking about below. And remember, this is just a summary of the Evangelist team &#8211; there are lots of other speakers and sessions.

## Raymond Camden

&#8220;[Introduction to LoopBack](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/1117A)&#8221;

**When:** Wednesday, 11:15 AM &#8211; 12:00 PM

Raymond says, &#8220;in this talk, I&#8217;ll discuss how to use the open-source LoopBack framework to rapidly build APIs in Node. I&#8217;ll show how to create a new LoopBack application, how to define an API, and then how to use it. If you want to learn how to build an API faster than a speeding bullet while seeing multiple unnecessary pictures of cats on slides, be sure to come to this talk!&#8221;

[&#8220;Combining OpenWhisk (Serverless), OpenAPI (Swagger) and IBM API Connect to Build Powerful APIs&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/4460A)

**When:** Wednesday, 4:15 PM &#8211; 5:00 PM

Using the power and simplicity of serverless functions and exposing them via IBM API Connect provides a clean and organized way to build powerful APIs for your developers and your customers. This session will go over both technologies, as well as OpenAPI, so you can see how the magic comes together.

[&#8220;Serverless Bots: Create Efficient Inexpensive, Event-Driven Bots with Node.js and OpenWhisk&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/3163A) _***Recommended!**_

**When:** Monday, 3:15 PM &#8211; 5:00 PM

THIS LAB REQUIRES AN [IBM BLUEMIX ACCOUNT](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/). YOU WILL NEED YOUR LOGIN ID AND PASSWORD IN THE LAB SESSION. Bots are the perfect use cases to understand the new serverless architectures: they&#8217;re self-contained, they have defined behaviors, and they&#8217;re fun! In this lab, we&#8217;ll create a simple bot that shows off the efficiencies and adaptability of serverless technologies, using Node.js and OpenWhisk. A Git template and complete instructions will be provided for attendees, so minimal coding experience is required. This is a good lab for those new to serverless, as well as for beginning to intermediate coders.

[&#8220;Create Quick Twitterbots with OpenWhisk!&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/7252A)

**When:** Tuesday, 11:00 AM &#8211; 1:45 PM

If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to create your own fun Twitterbot, OpenWhisk makes it easy. In 20 minutes you can create a simple function with OpenWhisk to set up a Twitterbot that tweets random phrases from a text file at scheduled intervals. (Prerequisites: please request Twitter API keys and authorize an app before attending the workshop.)

## David Okun

[&#8220;Developing Application End-to-End in Swift on the Cloud&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/5360A) (with Karl Weinmeister, IBM)

**When:** <span class="ng-binding">Tuesday, 1:30 PM &#8211; 2:15 PM </span>

Swift is ready for the cloud. Discover how you can leverage Swift on the cloud to increase productivity across client and server development teams. Find out how to use Swift now to empower development innovation. Understand the benefits of best-in-class package management and how you can leverage server-side packages for Cloudant, DB2 and Object Store to link your apps to back-end databases.

[&#8220;Extending Loopback: Taking Your API Further Out of the Box&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/2329A)

**When:** When: Tuesday, 3:00 PM &#8211; 3:20 PM

Loopback has quickly become one of the most impressive ways to jump-start an API written in Node.js. It has empowered today&#8217;s developer community to get their applications up and running in no time. Join David Okun from IBM as we explore some of the ways Loopback can be extended past what&#8217;s offered out-of-the-box, so that you can handle different data sources, web hooks, and even other JavaScript modules that you want to add to your application.

[&#8220;Cloud Intraoperability: Kitura and LoopBack as Microservices&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/2271A) **_*Highly Recommended!_**

**When:** Wednesday, 10:45 AM &#8211; 11:05 AM

There are so many choices available for creating easy-to-use, maintainable and extendable APIs. The work done by the Swift team on Kitura, and the StrongLoop team on LoopBack, gives modern mobile and JavaScript developers even more power to develop any API. At the same time, today&#8217;s applications usually require more than one out-of-the-box API. Join us to explore the basics of setting up LoopBack and Kitura as unique and discrete APIs to get your work done. You&#8217;ll also learn how they can speak to each other in the cloud to handle intensive processes, all while maintaining a good developer experience.
