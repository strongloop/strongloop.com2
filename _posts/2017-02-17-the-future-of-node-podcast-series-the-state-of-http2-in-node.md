IBM and StrongLoop partnered with [Changelog](https://changelog.com/) to sponsor &#8220;The Future of Node&#8221; Spotlight series, recorded at Node Interactive 2016 in Austin, Texas.

Changelog is a podcast and digital media company focused on telling developer-centric stories. They’re hacker to the heart. You may know them best from their popular podcast “The Changelog” &#8211; a weekly podcast that covers the technology and people of open source. It&#8217;s about the code, the people, and the community.

In this episode of _The Future of Node_ series recorded at Node Interactive 2016 Adam talked with James Snell (IBM Technical Lead for Node and member of Node&#8217;s TSC and CTC) about the work he&#8217;s doing on Node&#8217;s implementation of http2, the state of http2 in Node, what this new spec has to offer, and what the Node community can expect from this new protocol.
