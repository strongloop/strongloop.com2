We're pleased to announce a new meetup coming soon. 

Let’s welcome the beginning of summer and say goodbye to the first half of 2018 with a light-hearted integration workshop. Forget inviting clients to all-day PoTs and product pitches — this one’s for them, for the enterprises who want the agility of startups and the startups who want to be more established.

What does integration mean today? We’ll talk about how to connect systems and applications, but we’ll also go over trends, best practices, and success stories. Attendees are encouraged to share their projects and their curiosities and to apply them in the IBM Cloud environment. We’ll wrap up with a gamified roundtable.

All audiences welcome. Coffee and nibbles will be available at 8:30 and the event will kick off at 9:00AM. More details and registration below. We hope you will join us!
