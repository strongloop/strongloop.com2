IBM and StrongLoop partnered with Changelog to sponsor &#8220;The Future of Node&#8221; Spotlight series, recorded at Node Interactive 2016 in Austin, Texas.

Changelog is a podcast and digital media company focused on telling developer-centric stories. They’re hacker to the heart. You may know them best from their popular podcast “The Changelog” &#8211; a weekly podcast that covers the technology and people of open source. It&#8217;s about the code, the people, and the community.

In this episode from &#8220;The Future of Node&#8221; Spotlight series, host Adam Stacoviak talked with Sam Roberts (Node Runtimes at IBM) and Thomas Watson (Node.js Lead at Opbeat) about keeping Node Core small, what to put in, what to take out, how to deprecate and everything in-between.
