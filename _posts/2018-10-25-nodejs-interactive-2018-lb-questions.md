The LoopBack team was delighted to be part of the [Node+JS Interactive conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/node-js-interactive-2018/), which happened from October 10-12 in Vancouver. We were busy at the conference, during which we:

- Announced the release of LoopBack 4 GA during the [keynote](https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/2018/10/22/nodejs-interactive-keynote-create-deploy-scale-cloud-native-apis/) from Chris Bailey.

- Presented a session on [The Art of Building Node.js Projects at Scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6td2GaW3I&index=35&list=PLfMzBWSH11xaZvhv1X5Fq1H-oMdnAtG6k&t=0s) from [Raymond Feng](https://strongloop.com/authors/Raymond_Feng/).

- Hosted a hands-on workshop on "Create REST APIs in minutes with LoopBack 4" from [Diana Lau](https://strongloop.com/authors/Diana_Lau/) and [Biniam Admikew](https://strongloop.com/authors/Biniam_Admikew/).

- Connected with people during numerous great discussions at the IBM Booth.

There were a few questions about LoopBack that we heard from multiple attendess. Let us share some commonly asked questions we received during the conference.

**Q: What is LoopBack?**

A: LoopBack is a an open source Node.js API framework. Continued to be the leading API creation framework with out-of-box integration with 20+ databases and services, LoopBack 4 is a rewrite in TypeScript from ground up based on LoopBack 3.  It:
- Has a brand new core which makes this framework simpler to use and easier to extend than ever
- Supports OpenAPI for comprehensive bottom-up and top-down REST API experience
- Enables instant GraphQL endpoints from REST APIs


**Q: I missed the LoopBack workshop.  Can I find the lab instructions somewhere?**

A: Of course! You can find the tutorial here: https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/create-rest-apis-minutes-with-loopback-4/.

**Q: Can I use LoopBack to talk to other third-party services?**

A: Yes, you can connect to external services, such as REST and SOAP services, in your LoopBack application.  See [the documentation page](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Calling-other-APIs-and-web-services.html) and [the SOAP calculator tutorial](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/soap-calculator-tutorial.html) for more details.

**Q: I heard that LoopBack has GraphQL support.  Can you tell me more about it?**

A: We recently released a node module called [oasgraph](http://v4.loopback.io/oasgraph.html). It takes any REST API with an OpenAPI definition and give it a GraphQL gateway. [Our tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/create-rest-apis-minutes-with-loopback-4/) shows you how.

**Q: What if I missed the talk on building Node.js application at scale?**

A: Don't worry.  The recording has been posted [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H6td2GaW3I&index=35&list=PLfMzBWSH11xaZvhv1X5Fq1H-oMdnAtG6k&t=0s), and slides can be found in [here](https://sched.co/HYVB).
