IBM InterConnect is in one week! [Last week](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/listen-learn-strongloop-ibm-interconnect-2017/), we shared a rundown of what our StrongLoop evangelist team would be talking about at the event. Now, we&#8217;re excited to share more StrongLoop and IBM Sessions at IBM InterConnect 2017. This is by no means a complete list of the InterConnect sessions, so be sure to get an overview of the event with [Week at A Glance](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/agenda/) and use [Watson](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/watson/) get information on InterConnect sessions.

## Ritchie Martori

#### [&#8220;Scaling Your Microservices with LoopBack&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/4535A)

**When:** Tuesday, 1:30 PM &#8211; 2:15 PM
  
This talk focuses on building scalable and resilient microservices with LoopBack. We will go beyond best practices and show you real-world examples that demonstrate caching strategies, health checks, failover and other non-functional requirements for enterprise microservices.

## Krishna Raman and Behnam Hajian

[&#8220;Build, Deploy and Manage Microservices with IBM API Connect and Docker Container Orchestration&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/6581A)

**When:** Tuesday, 2:30 PM &#8211; 4:30 PM

In this lab, you will learn how to effectively deploy IBM API Connect in a Docker environment to create, secure and manage APIs and microservices. Using a Docker container orchestration (Swarm or Kubernetes), you will orchestrate a complete API Connect setup for different environments.

## Juan Carlos Soto and Nicola Palmarini

[&#8220;Elemental Design of a Digital Business&#8221;](https://myibm.ibm.com/events/interconnect/all-sessions/session/7257A)

**When:** Tuesday, 3:45 PM &#8211; 4:30 PM

      With the sophistication of APIs on the rise, barriers to market entry are lower than ever. This reality, coupled with Internet of Things technologies and partner ecosystems coming together quickly and offering new business value, is evident in the convergence of industries. The increase in the amount of critical connections—people, processes and hybrid clouds—has set off a change in how Digital Business Architectures are designed. These changing integration patterns now include application, data, messaging and API integrations. Join us to learn how companies are using these emerging patterns to create &#8220;points of presence&#8221; where they can interact with their customers at precisely the right time and elevate their experiences and expectations.

      APIs and microservices are the Yin/Yang of modern web applications. Microservices represent the core functionality of a system, and APIs are often created as a façade or composition from microservices. In this talk, we develop a sample scenario that uses a Node.js-based, open source LoopBack framework to create REST APIs; and explores gRPC as the backbone to connect multiple microservices written in Node.js, Java and other languages. In addition, we also experiment with how to trace interactions to provide end-to-end visibility. Such microservices are packaged as Docker containers and assembled together using Docker Compose. The session will help you understand how APIs and microservices are related, integrated and collaborated.

    <p>
      Docker, microservices, APIs, containers&#8230; these are some buzzwords that you might be hearing quite often these days. In this session, you will learn what they mean and their implications for your organization&#8217;s operations. We will show you how to create, secure and manage APIs and microservices using IBM API Connect in a development environment on a laptop, and then discuss and show scaling of the solution for production.
