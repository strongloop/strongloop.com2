The LoopBack framework is a powerful and flexible tool that can be used in many different ways. Some of these ways lead to better results while other can create headaches later in the project lifecycle. To make it easy for LoopBack users to do the right thing in their projects, we have created several Best Practice guides.

For example, automated testing is a topic that has been frequently raised by LoopBack users. Unfortunately testing was not considered in the design of pre-v4 versions and as a result, writing tests was cumbersome. The lack of official guidance and documentation was not helping either.

When we started to work on LoopBack 4, it was one of our design priorities to enable application developers to follow industry best practices, from test-driven development to user-centric/design-first approach to building APIs. As part of this effort, we wrote several documents to educate LoopBack developers about our recommended best practices.

At the moment, there are two guides: [Best Practices](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Best-practices.html) aiming at application developers and [Extending LoopBack](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Extending-LoopBack-4.html) aiming at extension developers.

## Best Practices for Applications

When it comes to automated testing, we feel it's important to understand the high level picture first: why are tests important, what should be tested and how to write a robust test suite that's easy to maintain. Our opinions are summarized in the chapter called [Defining your testing strategy](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Defining-your-testing-strategy.html).

Once we understand the testing strategy, it's time to figure out implementation details. The chapter called [Testing your application](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Testing-your-application.html) contains a ton of hands-on advice on a wide range of test-related topics, from project setup and data handling to code examples showing unit, integration and acceptance tests for various application artifacts like controllers and repositories.

Last but not least, we offer a guide on building applications using the code-first approach, where we start with an implementation (a domain model) and expose it via REST APIs by applying TypeScript decorators. Learn more in [Defining the API using code-first approach](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Defining-the-API-using-code-first-approach.html).

In the early alpha versions of the framework, we used to have a guide on building application design-first way too. The design-first approach starts with an API design phase, with the intention to find such API that will work great for API consumers and won't be unnecessarily constrained by implementation details. The actual implementation starts only after the API has been designed and described in an OpenAPI specification document.

Unfortunately, we did not manage to make this approach as easy to use as we would like to and therefore there is no guide yet. You can check out an old (and outdated) page [Thinking in LoopBack](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback.io/blob/d4ad2ca05f80f53cc70b3666f09aa729214ccc13/pages/en/lb4/Thinking-in-LoopBack.md) for a glimse of our vision. For now, you can use [lb4 openapi](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/OpenAPI-generator.html) to create initial scaffolding of controllers and models from an OpenAPI spec document. Note this CLI command is not able to update the implementation from changes made to the spec later as the project evolves.

Does the design-first approach resonate with you and would you like to build your application this way? We would love to hear from you! Just leave a comment in [GitHub issue #1882](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/1882).

## Bests Practices for Extensions

Extensibility is a core principle driving LoopBack 4 design. Our guide for extension developers covers the following topics at the moment:

- [How to start a new component](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Creating-components.html)
- [How to create a decorator](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Creating-decorators.html)
- [How to implement a custom Server](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Creating-servers.html)
- [How to test your extension](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Testing-your-extension.html)

## What's next

The Best Practice guides are living documents that will evolve together with the framework as the needs of our users grow.

Is there any topic you would like to see covered? Please check the existing [Docs issues](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ADocs) first and if there is no existing issue covering your topic, then open a new one to let us know.
