We're inviting you to join us in congratulating IBM and the LoopBack team for a recent achievement they have earned. The open-source Node.js framework LoopBack has won a 2019 API Award in the "Best in API Middleware" category!

The 2019 API Awards celebrate the technical innovation, adoption and reception in the API & Microservices industries and use by a global developer community. The 2019 API Awards will be presented at the 2019 API Awards Ceremony during the first day of [API World 2019](https://apiworld.co/) (Oct 8-10, 2019, San Jose Convention Center), the world’s largest API & Microservices conference & expo -- the largest event for the API economy -- in its 8th year, with over 3,500 attendees.

The 2019 API Awards received hundreds of nominations, and the Advisory Board to the API Awards selected LoopBack based on three criteria: (1) attracting notable attention and awareness in the API industry; (2) general regard and use by the developer & engineering community; and (3) being a leader in its sector for innovation. 

"IBM is a shining example of the API technologies now empowering developers & engineers to build upon the backbone of the multi-trillion-dollar market for API-driven products and services. Today’s cloud-based software and hardware increasingly runs on an open ecosystem of API-centric architecture, and IBM’s win here at the 2019 API Awards is evidence of their leading role in the growth of the API Economy,” said Jonathan Pasky, Executive Producer & Co-Founder of DevNetwork, producer of API Word & the 2019 API Awards.

"We're thrilled and honored to receive the Best in API Middleware 2019 award from API World," said Raymond Feng, Co-creator and Architect for LoopBack. "It's indeed a great recognition and validation of the LoopBack framework, team and community." 

He continued:

"Six and half years ago, we created LoopBack at StrongLoop aiming to help fellow developers kick off their API journey with the ideal Node.js platform. Thanks to the fantastic Node.js ecosystem, we were able to build on top of open source modules such as Express and make it dead-simple to create REST APIs out of existing datasources and services. Our bet on open APIs and Node.js was right. The project and community have grown significantly. We joined the IBM API Connect family in 2015 to continue our push for best as a strategic open source project by IBM. LoopBack 4 is the second generation of the framework. Leveraging what we have learned as well as new standards and technologies such as TypeScript, OpenAPI, GraphQL, and Cloud Native microservices, the new version sets a new foundation for even greater flexibility, extensibility, composablity, and scalability. More and more features are shipped and being built by us and the community. The LoopBack team strive to bring best practices and tools. We love Github stars. It's simply rewarding to create something valuable for the open source community!"
