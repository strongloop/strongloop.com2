The Toronto Cloud Integration Meetup is planning an event for Tuesday, February 5, 2019. The subject is near and dear to our hearts: "Quickly Build APIs with Existing Services and Data Using LoopBack!" If you are in town, we'd love to meet you as we cover this topic.

We interact with APIs regularly through our mobile and desktop devices! Modern apps and websites integrate them, and we want to help you build APIs off of existing services and data quickly and easily. To do so, some of our LoopBack 4 developers will demonstrate creating an API on top of databases and services in just a few steps, as well as show you how to test it. We will also have developers discuss integrating LoopBack with the latest technologies - Blockchain, Kafka, and more!

One of the purposes of this meetup is to bring awareness of this awesome Node.js framework to the Node.js community in Toronto. Of course, if you’re not using Node.js at this moment, feel free to join us and learn more!

Speakers from the LoopBack and IBM team include:

- Janny Hou - Since it’s our first LB4 Meetup, we’ll keep things light and interactive in this main presentation. We will share what LoopBack is and what you can do with it. We will also tell some of the story about the rationale behind the rewrite of the framework.

- Biniam Admikew - This demonstration will show how easy it is to expose REST API from your database with just a few steps.  We will go a bit deeper on the concepts and what’s happening in each steps.

- Jamil Spain demos on blockchain & loopback
