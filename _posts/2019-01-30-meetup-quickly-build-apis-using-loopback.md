APIs are critical to modern applications and websites! Do you want to know how to quickly build APIs off of existing services and data?

Details

In this MeetUp, the developers of LoopBack 4 walk you through how to create and test your APIs on top of databases and services in a few steps, and reveal the magic behind it. We will also have other professionals in the field discuss how you can integrate LoopBack with the latest technologies, such as Blockchain, Kafka, and more!

Speakers from the IBM team include:

Janny and Biniam will do the presentation and demo, respectively.  _i think_ Jamil is going to do demos on blockchain & loopback
