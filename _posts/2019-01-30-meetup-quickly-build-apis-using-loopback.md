The Toronto Cloud Integration Meetup is planning an event for Tuesday, February 5, 2019. The subject is near and dear to our hearts: "Quickly Build APIs with Existing Services and Data Using LoopBack!" If you are in town, we'd love to meet you as we cover this topic.

We interact with APIs regularly through our mobile and desktop devices! Modern apps and websites integrate them, and we want to help you build APIs off of existing services and data quickly and easily. To do so, some of our LoopBack 4 developers will demonstrate creating an API on top of databases and services in just a few steps, as well as show you how to test it. We will also have developers discuss integrating LoopBack with the latest technologies - Blockchain, Kafka, and more!

Speakers from the LoopBack and IBM team include:

- Janny Hou

- Biniam Admikew

- Jamil Spain demos on blockchain & loopback
