Last week we excitedly announced the [LoopBack 4 developer preview release](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/loopback-4-developer-preview-release). Your feedback helped fuel this transformation and how we built our open source framework. Now, as we are ready to launch the latest version of LoopBack, we are considering updating our LoopBack logo. We would like your feedback on some new logo and color palette options we have in mind.
