Even as it continues to work on improving [LoopBack 4](https://v4.loopback.io/), the LoopBack team also wants to ensure that the open-source community is able to develop skills with the framework. With this in mind, I want to point you towards two tutorials that are housed on the LoopBack site. These are end-to-end tutorials that allow you to learn LoopBack 4 concepts.



Tutorial for Extension Developers
Create new extensions and contribute to new features for LoopBack 4.

Tutorial for Application Developers
Create new applications using LoopBack 4 for all of your API needs.
