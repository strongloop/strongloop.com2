One of the things we knew would happen with the launch of [LoopBack 4](http://v4.loopback.io/) was an eventual redesign of the StrongLoop logo and site to match its branding colors.  We think the current look has a spark with the newly-incorporated shades of blue, while still maintaining enough familiarity in terms of content to connect to its roots.

Since its inception, StrongLoop utilized the greens incorporated in its original logo, and that of LoopBack. When we officially launched the current version of LoopBack this past Fall, it was a completely redesigned modular framework along with an entirely [new logo](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/thanks-loopback-4-logo/). While we talk about options on this site as well, we've been primarily linked with LoopBack since the start and wanted to mirror its current color scheme.

Besides updating the color scheme, long-time visitors may noticed we've updated the Projects listed as well as Frequently Asked Questions. With certain projects and products inactive or relocated to relevant IBM sites for over a year now, we've minimized references to them on this site for clarity. We've also ensured that we have a dynamic section on our home page prominently reflecting our latest blog content.

We anticipate that the site will continue to evolve in coming months, just as it has since we launched. We will continue listing the various events that the LoopBack team attends, as well as opportunities to learn more about develoiping with LoopBack. We'll also keep sharing news about API Microgateway and OASGraph, in addition to Node.js and OpenAPISpec. Open-source solutions for the API developer community is what we offer and feel strongly about!

We hope you like our new look, as well as how it still connects to our past.
