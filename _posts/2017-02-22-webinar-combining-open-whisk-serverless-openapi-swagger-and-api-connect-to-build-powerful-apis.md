Our next webinar will be held on March 16th, focusing on &#8220;Combining [OpenWhisk](https://lnkd.in/g9HBBwK) (serverless), [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org) (swagger) and [API Connect](https://lnkd.in/g9nTWKQ) to build powerful APIs&#8221;.

Using the power and simplicity of serverless functions and exposing them via API Connect provides a clean and organized way to build powerful APIs, applications and integrations for your developer and your customers. We will go over both technologies, as well as OpenAPI, to see how the magic comes together.
