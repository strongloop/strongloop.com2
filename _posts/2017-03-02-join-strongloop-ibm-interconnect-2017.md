Want to be part of the premier Cloud and Mobile conference? Join StrongLoop and IBM at InterConnect 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada! The event runs from March 19-23, and the StrongLoop team will once again unite with the larger IBM team at InterConnect. We look forward to helping people discover and learn about options for the Cloud, the Internet of Things, Watson, and more. And, of course, discovering and learning more about those things ourselves.<!--more-->

If you haven&#8217;t heard of InterConnect, the event site does a great job of telling you what to expect:

_&#8220;It’s time to put yourself in the driver’s seat, where your data works for you and open is your religion. Explore artificial intelligence, security, Internet of Things and cognitive — all on the IBM Cloud.&#8221;_

### Register Today!

Reserve your spot today and register for this event on the [official event page](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/interconnect/).

### Not Able to Make It? Join Us Next Year!

We posted a summary of InterConnect 2016 last year. In it, we provided [highlights of the event](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/ibm-interconnect-wrap-up/). However, we also knew that not everyone could attend. So, we will provide the same encouragement this time as we did almost a year ago: IBM InterConnect will return in 2018, and we encourage you to join us and meet some of the amazing talent at IBM that is working on Node.js and API Connect. In the meantime, dive into the API economy with [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/), our open source Node.js framework, or [IBM API Connect](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/api-connect?cm_mmc=Earned-_-IBM+Cloud_API+Economy-_-WW_WW-_-StrongLoop+API+Connect+Page_ov49843&cm_mmca1=000000WT&cm_mmca2=10002833&) for the enterprise.
