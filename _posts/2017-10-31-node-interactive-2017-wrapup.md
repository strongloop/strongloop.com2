Node Interactive has wrapped up for another year, and the 2017 event was another success. Held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the venue was provided a lot of competition to last year's host city of Austin, Texas. But as amazing as the scenery was, the attendees were there to learn more about node.js - and there was a lot for them to digest! 

By the way. whether you were lucky enough to attend and you just want to catch up on sessions you may have missed, or if you weren't able to attend, you can watch the recorded talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfMzBWSH11xYaaHMalNKqcEurBH8LstB8)!

The event ran from October 4-6, 2017. IBM is once more a Platinum Sponsor for this event, and we are all proud to be involved.

We also got a thorough [&#8220;State of the Union&#8221; for Express](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxGt_3F0ULg&list=PLfMzBWSH11xYaaHMalNKqcEurBH8LstB8&index=24) by [Doug Wilson](https://twitter.com/blipsofadoug). It was exciting watching the audience perk up when &#8220;Express 5&#8221; was mentioned (sorry no dates yet folks).


Day One at the convention center wrapped up with a BoothCrawl, giving attendees an opportunity to check out the technologies at the booths, get some swag, and enjoy the free drinks that rewarded a lomg day.

One highlight was Wednesday's JS Foundation Panel, moderated by Bocoup's Jory Burson. The topic at hand was "The Many Facets of Sustaining an Open Source Ecosystem", and great perspectives and insight were offered by IBM's Erin McKean, Microsoft's   Maggie Pint, and Node.js' Tracy Hinds. Their comments ranged from growth of Node.js, diversity within the Node ecosystem and 
the relationshops between corporatiosn and Open Source.




## The Attendee Party and Beyond

Attendee Party at Steamworks


Those who still had energy after the first day and booth crawl were rewarded with food, drink, and music at the Node Interactive Conference Party. The event was held at the Speakeasy, a fun venue that has a vintage bowling lane,  a photo booth to mark memories, and a view of Austin from the rooftop DJ lounge that was definitely something to enjoy!

There wasn&#8217;t really an after-party after day two (or at least not an official one), but we heard that the Code and Learn and Collaboration Summits on December 1 and 2 were amazing. We&#8217;ll certainly make sure to get those on our schedule next time!
