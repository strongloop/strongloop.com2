Node Interactive has wrapped up for another year, and the 2017 event was another success. Held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the event ran from October 4-6, 2017. IBM was Platinum Sponsor for this event, and we are all proud to have been involved.

Vancouver's fantastic scenery and pleasant weather provided a lot of competition to last year's host city of Austin, Texas. But as amazing as the scenery was, the attendees were there to learn more about node.js - and there was a lot for them to digest! We don't have space to give them all justice, so we'll share some highlights below.

The Node Foundation's Marke Hinkle began the event with a welcome and Node.js Update [keynote speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glB15kDpMl0&index=1&list=PLfMzBWSH11xa-iNnQG2555lgi4574nZOh). He covered the lates growth and adoption of Node.js, explained how the Node Foundation works, and encouraged people to learn more skills through Nodeschool.

Kim Crayton, Community Engineer and Advocate, presented thoughts on improving diversity and inclusivity efforts in her keynote, ["You Know What They Say About Good Intentions"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3y-EdNNkcsM&index=2&list=PLfMzBWSH11xa-iNnQG2555lgi4574nZOh). She talked about making this "Wild West" industry go beyond codes of conduct as reactive measures to be proactive and make communities safe, inclusive and diverse.

Another highlight was Wednesday's JS Foundation Panel, moderated by Bocoup's Jory Burson. The topic at hand was "The Many Facets of Sustaining an Open Source Ecosystem", and great perspectives and insight were offered by IBM's Erin McKean, Microsoft's  Maggie Pint, and Node.js' Tracy Hinds. Their comments ranged from growth of Node.js, diversity within the Node ecosystem and the relationshops between corporations and Open Source.

Day One at the convention center wrapped up with a BoothCrawl, giving attendees an opportunity to check out the technologies at the booths, get some swag, and enjoy the free drinks that rewarded a lomg day. Further rewards - and a lot of fun - followed in the Attendee Party, hosted at the nearby Steamworks Brew Pub. This party sprawled onto multiple floors with eager attenedees, tasty food and thirst-quenching beverages. When this party wrapped, several folks kept the party going by exploring the Vancouver nightlife - and they still managed to make it to the next day's early sessions.

The IBM booth showed off how a TJ Bot used Node Red and IBM's Watson to study Twitter mentions of #NodeInteractive. The bot assessed the sentiment and then displayed it with a specific color on a top-mounted light and an arm movement if it was a positive tweet. Conversations at the booth covered the code used to create the TJ Bot, how to use the open source [LoopBack}(www.loopback.io) framework, how [API Connect](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/getting-started/) can handle Enterrpise needs, and the various ways IBM uses [Node](https://developer.ibm.com/node/).

We've just scratched the surface for this amazing event.
