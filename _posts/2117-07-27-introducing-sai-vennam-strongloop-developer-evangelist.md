**Editor’s Note:** We're pleased to introduce you to the latest member of IBM’s StrongLoop Developer Evangelist team, Sai vennam. Our evangelists are quite busy attending events, hosting webinars, and putting together content about LoopBack and IBM’s API Connect. We have already introduced you to [Raymond Camden](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/introducing-raymond-camden-cat-person-who-occasionally-evangelizes/), [Joe Sepi](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/my-friends-call-me-joe-sepi-and-you-can-too/), [Erin McKean](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/introducing-erin-mckean-strongloop-lead-developer-evangelist/) and [David Okun](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/introducing-david-okun-strongloop-developer-evangelist/). 

Hi everyone! I’m the newest member on the StrongLoop Developer Evangelist team. I’ve been with IBM for 4 years as of last week. Fun fact - this actually makes me the most senior IBMer on my team while also being the youngest (25 last month). Although I was a software engineer before joining this team, it didn’t stop me from advocating and creating content for the products I worked on at IBM. the only difference is now I get paid to do it!

I’ll start with a little about myself. I remember the first computer I ever used: an MS-DOS PC in 1996. I used it to play Prince of Persia. As a kid it was one of the most magical experiences and I’ve been hooked ever since. Fast-forward to elementary school, I wrote my first program in QBasic on my Windows PC - it converted Fahrenheit to Celsius and vice versa. Combined with my love for gaming, this quickly led to programming simple games. My first serious coding project was actually on a TI-83 Graphing Calculator - lame I know. It was a calculator version of “Dance Dance Revolution”, complete with scoring system and basic graphics.

With my love for computers fully activated, I went on to study Computer Science at UNC (Go Tar Heels!). I graduated in 2013 and joined IBM shortly after. During my time here, I’ve had the pleasure of working really cool technology like [Bluemix](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/), a PaaS based on the open-source Cloud Foundry and Node.js, at the time an up-and-coming programming language with a solid foundation.

My introduction to StrongLoop actually came much prior to IBM’s acquisition. This very blog had so much valuable content for Node.js developers that I found myself landing on it from Google searches regularly. When talks of acquisition came up, I was the lead developer working on integration of StrongLoop’s [LoopBack](http://loopback.io/) and Arc (Arc has since been replaced by [API Connect](https://developer.ibm.com/apiconnect/getting-started/)) on to Bluemix. Following the acquisition, I joined the StrongLoop team full-time and the rest is history.

I’m really excited to be on this team and working with some of the most talented people at IBM. I still love coding and plan to continue contributing to API Connect. Having a firm grasp of the underlying API Connect codebase, I expect to drive consumer feedback into real change in the product. Expect to see and hear more from me at conferences, webinars and more blog posts in the near future! You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sai_vennam) or email me anytime at [svennam@us.ibm.com](mailto:svennam@us.ibm.com).

While I have you, I encourage you to check out Acme Freight, my first project as part of the StrongLoop Developer Evangelist team. It’s a best-practice sample application with a technology stack based entirely in Bluemix using StrongLoop’s LoopBack.
