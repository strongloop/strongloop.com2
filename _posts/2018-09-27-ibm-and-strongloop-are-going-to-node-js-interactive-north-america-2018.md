If you are curious what Node+JS Interactive offers, the event (which was known as JS Interactive previously) describes it like this:

*"Attendees collaborate face-to-face, network, and learn how to better their skills with JS in serverless, IoT, backend, and frontend. The program will cover a broad spectrum of the JavaScript ecosystem including Node.js, frameworks, best practices and stories from successful end-users."*

We invite you to join us at this event. It is a three-day technical deep dive in all things JavaScript and Node.js. As the platinum level sponsor, and one of the founders of the Node.js Foundation, we are committed to the advancement of Node.js and its thriving ecosystem.

Speakers from the IBM team include:

- Raymond Feng, IBM - [The Art of Building Node.js Projects at Scale](https://jsi2018.sched.com/event/HYVB)

- Nick O’Leary, Node-RED Project Lead, IBM Watson IoT Developer Advocate, IBM - [“Wiring the Internet of Things with Node-RED”](https://sched.co/F769)
