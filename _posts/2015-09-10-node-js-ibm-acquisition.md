Today is a very exciting day in the software industry and in the evolution of the Node.js project. I am delighted to announce that StrongLoop , the leader in enterprise Node solutions to power the API economy, has been [acquired by IBM](http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47577.wss), one of the most respected IT vendors on the planet. As part of IBM, we will be able to dramatically increase the pace of our innovation, global market reach and depth of our customer support. For enterprises who have not yet widely adopted Node, this move should instill in them the confidence that this technology is here to stay and is backed by world class organizations.

## **Better together**

From my very first meetings with IBM, it became clear to me that they were an ideal partner for the next phase of expansion of StrongLoop and to speed the adoption of Node in the enterprise. Both companies share a common vision of the changes taking place in the market and the critical role Node and open source play in the future of enterprise IT. StrongLoop has been all-in on this vision since our founding, demonstrated through the creation of a portfolio of Node based solutions, plus extensive contributions and leadership roles in the Node.js community. IBM is a recognized market leader in enterprise IT _and_ in open source. They are no stranger to the Node community, in fact they were a founding sponsor of [the Node Foundation](http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/06/nodejs-foundation-advances-community-collaboration-announces-new) when it launched earlier this year.

## **What’s next?**

With today&#8217;s announcement, StrongLoop becomes part of IBM’s market leading software portfolio which includes WebSphere, DataPower, Worklight, and more.  Not only will StrongLoop software continue to be available, but it will be integrated into IBM offerings including Bluemix, MobileFirst and WebSphere. Together, IBM and StrongLoop will bring to market a stream of innovative Java and Node solutions that enable companies to build a new generation of microservices and APIs that are both scalable and secure. It is these services and APIs that are powering the mobile and IoT initiatives at every enterprise in the midst of a digital transformation.

Our intentions with LoopBack and Express remain unchanged. With IBM resources we will now be able to amplify and accelerate in a way we could not have on our own.

Existing business relationships and support infrastructure will remain unchanged for now and StrongLoop will continue to provide the outreach and responsive support customers have come to expect from us.I am incredibly excited about the future of StrongLoop as part of the IBM family and the major milestone this represents for Node in the enterprise. I thank you for being part of it!
