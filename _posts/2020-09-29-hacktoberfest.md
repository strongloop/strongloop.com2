[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com).

## What is Hacktoberfest?

Hacktoberfest is an annual event encouraging participation in the open source community, open to everyone. Whether you’re new to development, a student, or a long-time contributor, you can help drive the growth of open source and make positive impact on an ever-growing community. All backgrounds and skills levels are encouraged to complete the challenge.

You can learn more about Hacktoberfest values at [https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#values](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#values).

Participants completing the challenge (contributing at least 4 valid pull requests) will earn a limited edition T-shirt.

_Please note that any prizes are subject to conditions set by Hacktoberfest. IBM and the LoopBack team are not involved and not responsible in any way._

## How to participate

Joining the effort is simple. Just pick any problem that is itching you and send a pull request to fix it. You can also choose one of LoopBack's issues labelled as [Hacktoberfest](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Astrongloop+label%3AHacktoberfest) or [good first issue](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+user%3Astrongloop+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) if you need inspiration.

Make sure to familiarize yourself with Hacktoberfest's [Participation rules](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#rules) and [Quality standards](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#quality); and also LoopBack's [Contributing guide](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Are you new to open source? No problem, we have you covered! Check out Hacktoberfest's [Beginners](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/details#beginners) guides and LoopBack's guide on [submitting a pull request to LoopBack 4](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/submitting_a_pr.html).

For the entire month of October, LoopBack's maintainers team will be giving extra priority to pull request reviews and helping new contributors along their journey to the first accepted contribution.

## Focus areas

We are primarily looking for quick wins with long term impact: small enhancements improving your day-to-day experience while using LoopBack.

As you may know, we have introduced a new documentation system in June to better organize the content and make it easier to find the information you need (see [New Documentation Structure](../june-2020-milestone/#new-documentation-structure) and [Alignment Along Abstraction Levels](../june-2020-milestone/#alignment-along-abstraction-levels)). The reorganization is still in progress and we would love to get some help. In particular, extracting recipes from "Concepts" explanations into proper "How-to guides" is an easy way how to quickly score valuable pull requests. See the GitHub issue [loopback-next#5783](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/5783) for the list of docs pages to rework.

Having said that, all improvements are welcome!

## Closing thoughts

We are looking forward to receive and eventually land your pull requests. Let's make LoopBack a better framework together!
