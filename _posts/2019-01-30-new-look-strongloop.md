One of the things we knew would happen with the launch of LoopBack 4 was an eventual redesign of the StrongLoop logo and site to match its branding colors. Since its inception, StrongLoop utilized the greens incorporated in its original logo, and that of LoopBack. When we officially launched the current version of LoopBack this past Fall, it was a completely redesigned modular framework along with an entirely [new logo](https://strongloop.com/strongblog/thanks-loopback-4-logo/). While we talk about OASGraph, API Microgateway, OpenAPI Spec and Node.js on this site as well, we've been linked with LoopBack primarily and wanted to mirror its colors. We think the current look, familiar in terms of content, has a new spark with the incorporated shades of blue.
