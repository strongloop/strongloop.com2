Peter McCaffrey, IBM&#8217;s Application Platform Marketing Director, gave us the low-down on the game:

&#8220;For those of you not familiar with the Code Rally Challenge, it is an open source racing game in which Developers program a vehicle (now in either Java or Node.js) to race around a virtual track. The game incorporates WAS Liberty, Bluemix, Java EE, Node.js and Node-RED and xc and is a fun way to introduce WebSphere technologies to the Developer community. The Code Rally Challenge appears all over the world in-person and also run through an annual Online Challenge in North America, Europe, Brazil, China and India. In 2015 the Code Rally Online Challenge grew 133% YTY- reaching 1,900 developers. We will be launching the 2016 Code Rally Online Challenge later this quarter. Stay tuned for more information.&#8221;
