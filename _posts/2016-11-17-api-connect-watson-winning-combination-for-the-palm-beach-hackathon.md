The [Palm Beach Tech Hackathon](http://hackathon.palmbeachtech.org/) was recently held from November 4-6th. This event is a great opportunity for teams of engineers, designers, developers and entrepreneurs to put forth a project for a chance to win a cash prize. We areÂ  proud to announce that Rick Blalock, a member of the IBM team, won first place &#8211; using API Connect and Watson!

Rick wanted his entry to creatively provide interactive and interesting exhibits at the [River Center](http://lrdrivercenter.org/) and the [South Florida Science Center](https://www.sfsciencecenter.org/). His submitted app walks visitors through a guided tour of exhibits, using IBM Watson to best choose which exhibits match visitors&#8217; interests. Visitors are able to talk to a virtual guide and be directed to their interest, audibly. The virtual guide can also ask the visitor questions while at an exhibit, thus getting valuable feedback. The virtual guide will store the feedback along with a tone analysis of the visitor to determine if they were confused, happy, intrigued, angry, while at the exhibit.

Rick was excited about the possibilities offered by IBM&#8217;s tools, stating &#8220;APIC + Watson is awesome! It was my first time using it and in less than 24 hours had a very functioning prototype using Watson API&#8217;s running through Loopback and to a web client.&#8221;

Congratulations to Rick for his winning idea! You can check out the entry piece on [Github](https://github.com/rblalock/pbhackathon-2016), and then see how easy it is to create APIs with API Connect!
