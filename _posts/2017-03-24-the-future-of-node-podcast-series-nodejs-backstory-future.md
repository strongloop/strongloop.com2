<p>IBM and StrongLoop sponsored Changelog’s The Future of Node Spotlight series at Node Interactive 2016. Adam spoke with event attendees about Node.js and the Node community. In this podcast, Adam discusses Node.js' backstory and its future.</p>

<p>Changelog is a podcast and digital media company that tells developer-centric stories. They’re hacker to the heart.

<p>Adam recorded this episode of The Future of Node series at Node Interactive 2016. He talked with Mikeal Rogers about the backstory of Node over the past few years to get to where we are today. They discuss io.js (the fork of Node), what's happened in the community and the code since that time frame, how The Node.js Foundation has helped to solidify the foundation on which the Node ecosystem is being built on, initiatives and focuses in the near future, and more.</p>
