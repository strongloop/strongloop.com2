Have you heard about the [Open API Initiative](https://www.openapis.org/) and its OpenAPI Specification? If so, you probably know how cool OpenAPI Spec is and that v3.0 is on its way. But maybe you want to know more about Open API Spec, getting others to try it out, and how to use it yourself.

Well, good news for those of you in San Francisco! There is an Open API Initiative (OAI) Meetup coming on September 14th!
