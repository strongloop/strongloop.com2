As applications evolve and developers are adding new features, so is evolving the structure of the backing database. In LoopBack 3, we provided JavaScript API for automatic migration of database schemas. Recently, we have improved LoopBack 4 to leverage these APIs and provide an easy-to-use database migration tool avaible from the command-line.

<!--more-->

For example, when the developer adds a new property to a model, they also need to define a new column in their SQL database schema. NoSQL databases like Cloudant and MongoDB don't require schema, but still require developers to define indices to speed up frequent queries.

Projects scaffolded with a recent version of our CLI tool `lb4` come with a new package script that automates the database migration process.

```
$ npm run migrate
```

Under the hood, this script is a thin wrapper for a new Application API contributed by the RepositoryMixin: [app.migrateSchema()](http://apidocs.loopback.io/@loopback%2fdocs/repository.html#RepositoryMixinDoc.prototype.migrateSchema). The method `migrateSchema` iterates over all datasources registered with the application and ask the underlying connector to migrate database schema. You can learn more in our documentation: [Database migrations](https://loopback.io/doc/en/lb4/Database-migrations.html), see also the pull requests [#2059](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2059) and
[#2094](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/pull/2094).

In the future, we would like to implement a more robust migration framework that will empower the developers to fully control database commands executed during the migration. We would like to work on these improvements together with our community, please join the discussion in GitHub [issue #487](https://github.com/strongloop/loopback-next/issues/487)
