	StrongLoop was founded at the end of 2012 in the San Francisco Bay Area. In March of 2013, StrongLoop introduced a Node.js distribution with enterprise support. At our launch, we announced our intention to embrace the community Node distribution and add features to improve enterprise adoption.  We followed up with <a href='http://loopback.io'>LoopBack</a>, our open-source Node.js framework, and then StrongLoop Arc, a graphical tool for creating LoopBack apps and running, managing, and monitoring Node applications.
