      <p>The past few years have seen an explosion of technologies - Microservices, Docker, Polyglot… the list goes on. But what about your development environment? Most developers still use a single-language Integrated Development Environment (IDE), debugger, and local tools, that they were using years ago. It’s high time to upgrade!
<p>
Microclimate is a Docker-ized, end-to-end development environment. Generate microservices in Java, Node, and Swift, edit them, and see your changes on the fly. When you’re happy with the code, check it in and the pipeline automatically builds and deploys to Kubernetes.
<p>
And Microclimate is not just another friendly IDE! It includes application monitoring tools and an HTTP load-driver to start, and plan to include other tools over time. Each of these is pre-installed and pre-configured for your service so you can just switch tabs and go - no hunting for other tools or trying to set them up when you run into problems.

The Open API Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format. SmartBear Software is donating the Swagger Specification directly to the OAI as the basis of this Open Specification. The OAI recently announced the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openapis.org/blog/2017/07/26/the-oai-announces-the-openapi-specification-3-0-0">OpenAPI Specification 3.0.0.</a></p>
      <p>APIs form the connecting glue between modern applications. Nearly every application uses APIs to connect with corporate data sources, third party data services or other applications. Creating an open description format for API services that is vendor neutral, portable and open is critical to accelerating the vision of a truly connected world.</p>
