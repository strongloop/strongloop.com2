Alan Cha is a new hire software engineer at IBM Research, focusing on building tools for APIs and new API technologies. During his previous internships, he worked on projects like [API Harmony](http://ibm.biz/apiharmony) a service to find, learn about, and use APIs, and [OASGraph](v4.loopback.io/oasgraph.html), a library to generate in memory wrappers for REST(-like) APIs. Outside of work, he tries to find time for his hobbies which range from growing carnivorous plants to Chinese lion dancing and instant photography to origami.
