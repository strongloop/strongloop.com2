This is Raymond, a co-founder from StrongLoop. I work on LoopBack, our open source mobile API platform built on and for Node.js.

For many years, I have been developing Enterprise Java integration platforms, including IBM WebSphere Process Server, Apache Tuscany, and a Mobile Backend for Shutterfly. I also co-authored Tuscany SCA in Action. A year ago, I discovered Node.js. I quickly fell in love with the technology and the great community around it. Coming from deep Java background, I really appreciate Node.js for its flexibility and productivity to mash up various backend systems and expose APIs in a much simpler way at my will. Once again, I'm reinventing the middleware in Node.js for an even more exciting target: Mobile. Mobile is the future and Node.js is for mobile. I hope that you agree with me and I invite you to join the movement.
