This is Mario Estrada, a passionate about new technology that can improve our daily lives. I currently lead the R&D department for www.eycgrupo.com, a consulting firm in Latin America, co-authored the book Informix Unleashed back in 1998.

I formally started my consulting journey back in 1999 when I lead, developed and deployed a Data Warehouse project for British American Tobacco in Central America using IBM Informix products, since then I have been involved in projects for the Enterprise using Java Technologies, Messaging Systems, Angular, React and all kind of databases that help companies mobilize their services and products. I recently started working with Node JS and we took a major decision to start working in a real project for a Retail Bank using **LoopBack 4**. I love the framework architecture and started supporting it to attract more developers and help the community grow.
