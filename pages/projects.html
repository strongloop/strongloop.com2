        LoopBack is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that enables you to:
        <ul>
          <li>Create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs with little or no coding.</li>
          <li>Access data from major relational databases, MongoDB, SOAP, and REST APIs.</li>
          <li>Incorporate model relationships and access controls for complex APIs.</li>
          <li>Use separable components for file storage, third-party login, and OAuth 2.0.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The Microgateway is a developer-focused, extensible gateway framework written
in Node.js for enforcing access to Microservices &amp; APIs. It supports the
following core features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure and control access to APIs using Swagger (OpenAPI) Specification</li>
<li>Collection of pre-built gateway policies for API Key validation, OAuth 2.0,
rate limiting, and JavaScript</li>
<li>Create gateway policies (security, routing, integration, etc... ) using
Swagger extensions (API Assembly)</li>
<li>Simple interfaces for creating your own gateway policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>The role of a Gateway in an API architecture is to protect, enrich and
control access to API services. These sets of capabilities are often related
to security and rate limiting, but it also includes the ability to do deeper
message inspection.  For example, you may want to insure that the message
received is properly formed JSON, XML, or data following your own specific
format.  In addition, the Gateway can modify the payload or transform it to
meet old or new interfaces for the API backend. Finally, the Gateway can
invoke multiple services and aggregate responses from multiple API backends.</p>
<p>The Microgateway is the foundation for all of those things. It is optimized
to perform security, rate limiting, and much more complex packet processing
through a highly flexible flow-engine.</p>
<p>The flow-engine is a processing unit that allows you to define a sequence
of processing policies or tasks that get applied to the transaction as it
passes through the Gateway for a specific API. These policies may be organized
in a linear fashion, executing in sequential order. Or, they may have
conditional logic deciding which set of policies will execute depending on
variables that are part of the API flow.</p>

        <a name="openapi"></a><h2 class="c-heading -h2">OpenAPI</h2>
        <p>The Open API Initiative (OAI) was created by a consortium of forward-looking industry experts who recognize the immense value of standardizing on how REST APIs are described. As an open governance structure under the Linux Foundation, the OAI is focused on creating, evolving and promoting a vendor neutral description format. SmartBear Software is donating the Swagger Specification directly to the OAI as the basis of this Open Specification. </p>
        <p>APIs form the connecting glue between modern applications. Nearly every application uses APIs to connect with corporate data sources, third party data services or other applications. Creating an open description format for API services that is vendor neutral, portable and open is critical to accelerating the vision of a truly connected world.</p>
