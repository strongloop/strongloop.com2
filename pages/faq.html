ques="Are there other options for LoopBack support?"
ans="IBM recently enhanced its Node.js support and added support for LoopBack and Express. IBM Foundation Support for Runtimes provides coverage for Node.js, Swift and Java. Support is available for the Node.js 6 & 8 LTS binaries from the nodejs.org community and the IBM SDK for Node.js, which includes the open sourced [App Metrics] (https://developer.ibm.com/node/monitoring-post-mortem/application-metrics-node-js/) monitoring framework.

This support is available regardless of which modules you are using within your application and wherever you want to deploy the runtime - on your own machines or in the cloud, and whether thatâ€™s IBM Cloud, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Heroku or somewhere else.

IBM Advanced Support for Runtimes expands on Foundation Support, providing additional coverage for the Express.js, Loopback, and Kitura (Swift framework) frameworks as well as the packages on which they rely.

These offerings provide you with the majority of what you need in order to be able to create, deploy, monitor and scale production-grade web applications and mobile back ends using Node.js. Visit [IBM's marketplace](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/support-for-runtimes) to learn more."
